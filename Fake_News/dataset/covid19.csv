State health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that four each have been discharged from hospitals in Golaghat and Guwahati. Assam so far has 35 positive cases of which 27 have been discharged and one patient has died. “With Sunday’s discharge, we have seven more patients to go, including the first patient, who is continuing treatment at Silchar Medical College because his swab samples are still showing positive results,” Sarma said. The 52-year-old man from Karimganj had contracted the virus duing the Tablighi Jamaat congregation held at Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi and was admitted in Silchar medical college and hospital on March 31. He is a cancer patient. “For a state like Assam, the recovery rate of 77 per cent so far will perhaps be seen as an achievement for us,” Sarma said. The state has conducted 7,616 sample tests so far in the six laboratories in the state and of these 35 tested positive and 209 results are still awaited with the remaining being negative.

372,CDC RUSHES OUT PANDEMIC GUIDANCE FOR RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AFTER SURPRISE TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT,"After weeks of butting heads with the Trump administration over pandemic guidance, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued guidance on Friday for the reopening of religious institutions.

“Gathering together for worship is at the heart of many faith traditions,” reads a statement from the CDC.

“Because there are several published reports of COVID-19 outbreaks sparked by large gatherings, both non-religious and religious in nature, the recommendations released today will help guide faith communities while respecting their fundamental right to gather for worship.”

Recommendations include;

Encouraging staff and congregants to wash their hands with soap and water
Providing hand sanitizer
No-touch trash cans
Encouraging the use of cloth masks
“Suspending or at least decreasing use of a choir/musical ensembles and congregant singing, chanting, or reciting during services,”
Daily disinfection
Social distancing
Limiting the sharing of objects such as books and hymnals
Identify an area to quarantine people with COVID-19 symptoms
If someone in a congregation is diagnosed with COVID-19, perform contact tracing and inform anyone with exposure to the person to stay home and self-monitor
Close off any area used by a sick person and do not use until it has been disinfected – which should be performed at least 24 hours later.
Designate a staff member to handle COVID-19 concerns. The revised guidance comes after President Trump told a Michigan roundtable on Thursday “I said, ‘You better put it out,’” – one day before calling an impromptu press conference where he announced that places of worship would be deemed “essential,” and called for their reopening.

Trump said that he would “override” governors who keep places of worship closed. ",FAKE
33,BRONX ER DOCTOR EXPLAINS WHY REOPENING THE ECONOMY NOW MIGHT ACTUALLY SAVE LIVES,"Last night, after we reported on a pair of ER doctors arguing that the US states should lift their lockdowns immediately (during the course of their argument, which was mostly rooted in trends they’ve witnessed first hand, they apparently made the error of bringing up ‘personal liberty’ and ‘the Constitution’, words that prompt progressives to stop listening and start squawking about killing grandma to further enrich the billionaires) YouTube decided that their argument constituted ‘misinformation’ about the coronavirus outbreak and deleted the video after it racked up more than 5 million views.

We found that curious, since even doctors and epidemiologists have told mainstream news organizations that our understanding of the virus is still developing, and things we thought weren’t accurate just weeks ago and now being re-examined. One such aspect is the heavy handed lockdown response implemented across the US, and elsewhere. Urban leftists and out-of-touch Silicon Valley billionaires simply don’t understand that there are millions of Americans out there – many of whom happen to be white – who are absolutely terrified about losing their livelihoods, and don’t understand why all of this is necessary to combat a virus that leaves the vast majority of those infected unscathed.

The first rounds of ‘surveillance’ testing in the US, carried out in New York and in California’s Santa Clara County (the Cali effort was part of a private study, while New York State is testing random samples of the population to try and discern how widely spread the virus has already become) have suggested that the number of total cases is much, much higher than official numbers reflect. The most recent data released by Gov. Cuomo suggest that 1 in 4 people in NYC might already be infected, a figure that rises to 40% in some poorer areas like parts of the Bronx, where most workers are ‘essential’.

Many have blamed politicians for sending ‘mixed messages’ to the public, but the truth is, the message has changed along with our understanding and experience dealing with the virus.

And now, an ER doctor at a hospital in the Bronx is arguing that it’s time to reopen the economy, while pointing out that many thousands of unnecessary deaths could result if we don’t reopen quickly enough, as millions of Americans delay or skip critical preventative care, including people with heart disease and other health issues that make doing so particularly dangerous.

Daniel Murphy, an emergency room physician at St. Barnabas Hospital in The Bronx. Murphy contracted the virus during the early days of the outbreak, and accidentally spread it to members of his family. Luckily, they all quickly recovered and he returned to work in time for the big rush.

Murphy readily acknowledged that the outbreak has been by far the worst public health emergency of his 30-year career in medicine.

COVID-19 has been the worst health-care disaster of my 30-year ­career, because of its intensity, duration and potential for lasting impact. The lasting impact is what worries me the most. And it’s why I now believe we should end the lockdown and rapidly get back to wor.

From mid-March through mid-April, the ER staff at St. Barnabas huddled in groups of about 20 every morning. We asked ourselves what had happened over the previous shift. We generated a list of action­able tasks for the following 24 hours. At first, we addressed personal protective equipment and the management of patients with mild illness who were seeking COVID-19 tests.

Two weeks ago, Murphy said, their ER was slammed with calls, and patients were dying from severe COVID-19 left and right. But as the curve has ‘flattened’ – a trend closely documented by data collected by New York State – Murphy and his team have noticed a massive drop in emergency patients with COVID-19.

Then came the wave of critically ill patients in numbers none of us had ever seen. This lasted for two weeks. The number of patients on ventilators accumulated in the ER and throughout the hospital. We witnessed an unprecedented number of deaths. The tone of the huddles became more somber. We became accustomed to the morbidity; we did our jobs.

It is precisely what I have witnessed that now tells me that it’s time to ease the lockdown. Here’s why.

Then, all of sudden, on April 7 at 1 pm, Murphy noticed that the non-stop parade of ambulances carrying critically ill COVID-19 patients seemed to have stopped suddenly. From that point on, the number of ER admissions started to decline precipitously.

First, the wave has crested. At 1 p.m. on April 7, the COVID-19 arrivals slowed down. It was a discrete, noticeable event. Stretchers became available by 5 p.m., and the number of arriving COVID-19 patients dropped below the number discharged, transferred or deceased.

That drop was “striking”, as the doctor explained, because the community he serves is overwhelmingly poor, and sported high rates of infection. The surveillance data released by NY State so far suggests that the area surrounding the hospital may have seen infection rates climb as high as 40%.

The mechanics of this ebb and flow have led Dr. Murphy to suspect that the lockdowns have actually done little to blunt the ‘peak’, a conclusion that’s supported by Sweden’s policies and outcomes.

This was striking, because the community I serve is poor. Some are homeless. Most work in “essential,” low-paying jobs, where distancing isn’t easy. Nevertheless, the wave passed over us, peaked and subsided. The way this transpired tells me the ebb and flow had more to do with the natural course of the outbreak than it did with the lockdown.

Whatever Murphy’s first-hand experience might suggest about the usefulness of lockdowns, what’s wrong with waiting a few more weeks, just in case he’s wrong? Well, Murphy explains, even if we set aside the economic damage and its long-term ramifications for personal health, there’s an even more urgent issue at hand: Because of the lockdowns, too many Americans are delaying critical non-COVID-19 care.

The problem is that in addition to the drop in coronavirus patients, the hospital has also reported a massive drop in patients of all types and categorizations as more people are apparently staying home despite injuries or symptoms that are probably critical for fear of catching the virus. There’s simply no other explanation for such a statistically significant drop.

Without a doubt, many of those who aren’t healthy but have opted to delay care that could prevent lethal strokes, heart attacks or other diseases.

Second, I worry about non-coronavirus care. While the inpatient units remain busy with sick COVID-19 patients, our ER has been quiet for more than a week. We usually average 240 patients a day. For the last week, we averaged fewer than 100. That means our patients in this diverse, low-income community are afraid to come to the ER for non-COVID care.

Gotham-wide, the number of 911 ambulance runs declined to 3,320 on April 18, down from a peak of 6,527 on March 30, according to New York Fire Department data. The current nadir is significantly below the average.

A large share of those staying home surely have emergency medical and surgical conditions not related to the novel coronavirus. The growing numbers ­dying at home during this crisis must include fatal myocardial infarctions, asthma exacerbations, bacterial infections and strokes.

Another huge problem that has been almost completely ignored is that child vaccination rates have plummeted during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, our pediatric volume in the ER has practically disappeared. Visits to primary-care pediatricians are also down, with vaccine schedules falling behind. Everyone seems to be avoiding the health system — an important and unfortunate consequence of the stay-at-home strategy.

Third, inordinate fear misguides the public response. While COVID-19 is serious, fear of it is being over-amplified. The public needs to understand that the vast majority of infected people do quite well.

And finally, as we noted above, Dr. Murphy argued that the virus is already much more pervasive than official data reflect.

Finally, COVID-19 is more prevalent than we think. Many New Yorkers already have the COVID-19 infection, whether they are aware of it or not. As of today, over 43 percent of those tested are positive in The Bronx. We are developing a significant degree of natural herd immunity. Distancing works, but I am skeptical that it is playing as predominant a role as many think.

There’s no question that testing is “important work”, Dr. Murphy added. But there’s no reason it can’t happen “in parallel” to an economic reopening. And even as it stands, scientists continue to find flaws with tests that call their results into question. All of this will likely take months, if not years to sort out. And we simply can’t wait that long without making the ‘cure’ more damaging than the ‘disease’.

More testing will better establish the numbers among those with mild illnesses and no symptoms. My professional ­experience tells me the number of infected people will be high. Testing is important work, but it should happen in parallel to the immediate resuscitation of the economy and getting people back to work.

At present, the testing is ­imperfect. We can’t wait months. We must protect the vulnerable and mitigate without destroying the economy.

So, will Google and YouTube censor Dr. Murphy, too?",FAKE

324,STUDY: LOCKDOWN “WILL DESTROY AT LEAST SEVEN TIMES MORE YEARS OF HUMAN LIFE” THAN IT SAVES,"A study has found that the “stay at home” lockdown order in the United States will “destroy at least seven times more years of human life” than it saves and that this number is “likely” to be more than 90 times greater.

As we have repeatedly highlighted, the untold cost of the lockdown in terms of untreated serious illnesses and the impact on mental health will not be fully known for years, but discussion around the issue has been limited in the mainstream media.

Now a new study finds that debilitating stress and anxiety caused by the lockdown, including turmoil caused by huge job losses, could lead to a plethora of negative health problems that will have a far greater overall toll on human life than the number of lives saved by the lockdown.

“Based on a broad array of scientific data, Just Facts has computed that the anxiety created by reactions to Covid-19—such as stay-at-home orders, business shutdowns, media exaggerations, and legitimate concerns about the virus—will destroy at least seven times more years of human life than can possibly be saved by lockdowns to control the spread of the disease. This figure is a bare minimum, and the actual one is likely more than 90 times greater.”

Research shows that at least 16.8% of adults in the United States have suffered “major mental harm from responses to Covid-19.”

Extrapolating these numbers out, the figures show that “anxiety from responses to Covid-19 has impacted 42,873,663 adults and will rob them of an average of 1.3 years of life, thus destroying 55.7 million years of life.”

This contrasts with “a maximum of 616,590 lives (which) might be saved by the current lockdowns, and the disease robs an average of 12 years of life from each of its victims, which means that the current lockdowns can save no more than 7.4 million years of life.”

The seven times figure is a massively conservative estimate which minimizes the impact of the negative consequences of lockdown and maximizes the number of lives affected by lockdown.

“Under the more moderate scenarios…anxiety will destroy more than 90 times the life saved by lockdowns,” states the study.

The study lists a number of reasons why the lockdown has increased anxiety and depression, one of which includes the media’s role in exaggerating the deadliness of COVID-19 and “using false denominators that exaggerate its death rate.”

“This research is engaging and thoroughly answers the question about the cure being worse than the disease,” concluded Joseph P. Damore, Jr., M.D., who reviewed the study.

As we highlighted earlier, psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, during the lockdown months of March and April compared to January and February.",FAKE

221,"SLIPPERY SLOPE TO DESPOTISM: PAVED WITH LOCKDOWNS, RAIDS, AND FORCED VACCINATIONS","“You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”—Alan Dershowitz, Harvard law professor

You have no rights.

That’s the lesson the government wants us to learn from this COVID-19 business.

Well, the government is wrong.

For years now, the powers-that-be—those politicians and bureaucrats who think like tyrants and act like petty dictators regardless of what party they belong to—have attempted to brainwash us into believing that we have no right to think for ourselves, make decisions about our health, protect our homes and families and businesses, act in our best interests, demand accountability and transparency from government, or generally operate as if we are in control of our own lives.

We have every right, and you know why? Because we were born free.

As the Declaration of Independence states, we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights—to life, liberty, property and the pursuit of happiness—that no government can take away from us.

Unfortunately, that hasn’t stopped the government from constantly trying to usurp our freedoms at every turn. Indeed, the nature of government is such that it invariably oversteps its limits, abuses its authority, and flexes its totalitarian muscles.

Take this COVID-19 crisis, for example.

What started out as an apparent effort to prevent a novel coronavirus from sickening the nation (and the world) has become yet another means by which world governments (including our own) can expand their powers, abuse their authority, and further oppress their constituents.

Until now, the police state has been more circumspect in its power grabs, but this latest state of emergency has brought the beast out of the shadows.

We are on a slippery slope to outright despotism.

This road we are traveling is paved with lockdowns, SWAT team raids, mass surveillance and forced vaccinations. It is littered with the debris of our First and Fourth Amendment freedoms.

This is what we have to look forward to in the months and years to come unless we can find some way to regain control over our runaway government.

The government has made no secret of its plans.

Just follow the money trail, and you’ll get a sense of what’s in store: more militarized police, more SWAT team raids, more surveillance, more lockdowns, more strong-armed tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and forcing us to comply with the government’s dictates.

It’s chilling to think about, but it’s not surprising.

We’ve been warned.

Remember that Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command? The one that anticipates the future domestic political and social problems the government is grooming its armed forces to solve through the use of martial law?

The chilling five-minute training video, obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request and made available online, paints a dystopian picture of the future bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.

But here’s the kicker: what they’re really talking about is martial law, packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security.

This COVID-19 crisis is pushing us that much closer to that dystopian vision becoming a present-day reality.

For starters, let’s talk about the COVID-19 stormtroopers, SWAT team raids, and ongoing flare-ups of police brutality.

With millions of dollars in stimulus funds being directed towards policing agencies across the country, the federal government plans to fight this COVID-19 virus with riot gear, gas masks, ballistic helmets, drones, and hi-tech surveillance technology.

Indeed, although crime rates have fallen dramatically in the midst of this global COVID-19 lockdown, there’s been no relief from the brutality and violence of the American police state.

While the majority of the country has been social distancing under varying degrees of lockdowns, it’s been business as usual for the nation’s SWAT teams and police trained to shoot first and ask questions later.

In Kentucky, plain-clothed cops in unmarked cars used a battering ram to break down Breonna Taylor’s door and carry out a no-knock raid on her home after midnight. Fearing a home invasion, the 26-year-old emergency medical technician and her boyfriend—who had been in bed at the time of the invasion—called 911 and prepared to defend themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend shot one of the intruders—later identified as police—in the leg. Police fired at least 20 shots into the apartment and a neighboring home, killing Taylor. The drug dealer who was the target of the late-night raid lived 10 miles away and had already been arrested prior to the raid on Taylor’s home.

In Illinois, police opened fire in a subway station, shooting a 33-year-old man who allegedly resisted their attempts to tackle and arrest him for violating a city ordinance by passing between two cars of a moving train. Ariel Roman, a short-order cook, claimed he was suffering from an anxiety attack when he was “harassed, chased, tackled, pepper-sprayed, tasered and shot twice” by police.

In Maryland, police dispatched on a nuisance call to break up a crowd of neighborhood kids( half of them teenagers, and the other half youngsters around 4 and 5 years old) gathered in an apartment complex parking lot opened fire on a 29-year-old man seen exiting his car with a gun. An eyewitness claimed “the officer pointed a flashlight and his gun at the group immediately and began chasing and shooting a minute or two after getting out of the patrol car.” Police reportedly shot the man after he threw down his gun and ran in the opposite direction.

In Virginia, more than 80 local, state, and federal police agents risked spreading COVID-19 to “a highly vulnerable population” when they raided a low income, public housing community in an effort to crackdown on six individuals suspected of selling, on average, $20 to $100 worth of drugs.

In Texas, a SWAT team backed up with a military tank Armored Personnel Carrier raided Big Daddy Zane’s Bar whose owner and patrons were staging a peaceful First and Second Amendment protest of the governor’s shutdown orders.

Police have even been called out to shut down churches, schools and public parks and beaches that have been found “in violation” of various lockdown orders.

Now there’s talk of mobilizing the military to deliver forced vaccinations, mass surveillance in order to carry out contact tracing, and heavy fines and jail time for those who dare to venture out without a mask, congregate in worship without the government’s blessing or re-open their businesses without the government’s say-so.

There are rumblings that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will start thermal screenings to monitor passengers’ temperatures in the coming weeks. This is in addition to the virtual strip searches that have become routine aspects of airport security.

Restaurants in parts of the country are being tasked with keeping daily logs of phone numbers, emails, and arrival times for everybody who participates in dine-services, with no mention of how long such records will be kept on file, with whom they will be shared, and under what circumstances.

With the help of Google and Nest cameras, hospitals are morphing into real-time surveillance centers with round-the-clock surveillance cameras monitoring traffic in patients’ rooms. Forget patient privacy, however. Google has a track record of sharing surveillance footage with police.

And then rounding out the power-grabs, the Senate just voted to give police access to web browsing data without a warrant, which would dramatically expand the government’s Patriot Act surveillance powers. The Senate also voted to give Attorney General William Barr the ability to look through the web browsing history of any American — including journalists, politicians, and political rivals — without a warrant, just by saying it is relevant to an investigation. If enacted, privacy experts warn that the new provisions threaten to undermine the free press by potentially preventing the media from exposing abuses of power or acting as a watchdog against political leaders.

If we haven’t already crossed over, we’re skating dangerously close to that line that keeps us on the functioning side of a constitutional republic. It won’t take much to push us over that edge into a full-blown banana republic.

In many ways, this is just more of the same heavy-handed tactics we’ve been seeing in recent years but with one major difference: this COVID-19 state of emergency has invested government officials (and those who view their lives as more valuable than ours) with a sanctimonious, self-righteous, arrogant, Big Brother Knows Best approach to top-down governing, and the fall-out can be seen far and wide.

It’s an ugly, self-serving mindset that views the needs, lives and rights of “we the people” as insignificant when compared to those in power.

That’s how someone who should know better such as Alan Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, can suggest that a free people—born in freedom, endowed by their Creator with inalienable rights, and living in a country birthed out of a revolutionary struggle for individual liberty—have no rights to economic freedom, to bodily integrity, or to refuse to comply with a government order with which they disagree.

According to Dershowitz, who has become little more than a legal apologist for the power elite, “You have no right not to be vaccinated, you have no right not to wear a mask, you have no right to open up your business… And if you refuse to be vaccinated, the state has the power to literally take you to a doctor’s office and plunge a needle into your arm.”

Dershowitz is wrong: while the courts may increasingly defer to the government’s brand of Nanny State authoritarianism, we still have rights.

The government may try to abridge those rights, it may refuse to recognize them, it may even attempt to declare martial law and nullify them, but it cannot litigate, legislate or forcefully eradicate them out of existence.

Up to now, we’ve been largely passive participants in this experiment in self-governance. Our inaction and inattention has left us at the mercy of power-hungry politicians, corrupt corporations, and brutal, government-funded militias.

Wake up, America.

As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, these ongoing violations of our rights—this attitude by the government that we have no rights—this tyrannical movement that is overtaking our constitutional republic and gaining in momentum and power by the minute—this incessant auction block in which government officials appointed to represent our best interests keep selling us out to the highest bidder—all of these betrayals scream for a response.

To quote the great Rod Serling: “If we don’t listen to that scream—and if we don’t respond to it—we may well wind up sitting amidst our own rubble, looking for the truck that hit us—or the bomb that pulverized us. Get the license number of whatever it was that destroyed the dream. And I think we will find that the vehicle was registered in our own name.”

606,OPERATION HAIRCUT: HAIRSTYLISTS TO PROTEST GOV. WHITMER STRIPPING BARBER’S LICENSE FOR REOPENING,"A conservative group is organizing a civil disobedience demonstration in Michigan after Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer stripped a barber of his license for trying to reopen his business.

The group, called the Michigan Conservative Coalition, is organizing with dozens of barbers and hairstylists to give haircuts outside the Michigan capitol building on May 20 as an act of defiance against Whitmer’s tyranny.  “To show people we are not unintelligent – the workers and the business owners of Michigan – we all know how to behave in this new world,” said MCC organizer Meshawn Maddock. “There is no reason why barbers and stylists can’t safely cut hair.”

The planned mass demonstration was inspired by 77-year-old barber Karl Manke, who continued to give haircuts despite the shutdown, resulting in Whitmer stripping him of his license earlier this month. “The fact that a 77-year-old barber became a leader in our state (as) the first person brave enough to risk his license, to stand up to our governor,” Maddock said.

“We are proud of him and we were impressed by him. And immediately other hair stylists and barbers reached out to us and said what can I do?”

Manke responded to Whitmer’s action last week, declaring he would not shutter his business because she says so.

“I’m not closing up; I’m not caving in to this,” Manke said, adding: “I’m not a rabble-rouser and I’m not a scofflaw. I’m a small-town barber. I just want to make my living.”",FAKE
895,TUCKER CARLSON: “THE VIRUS ISN’T NEARLY AS DEADLY AS WE THOUGHT IT WAS”,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson appeared to join those demanding a move to re-open society as soon as possible when he said during his show last night “the virus isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.”

Carlson questioned why the San Francisco Bay area was expanding its lockdown for another five weeks until the end of May.

“What is the scientific justification for doing that?” he asked. “They didn’t tell us because there is none. None.” Tucker said that “radical steps” necessary to “flatten the curve” were proposed and that curve has now been flattened, “but it’s likely not because of the lockdowns, the virus just isn’t nearly as deadly as we thought it was.”

“It turned out not to be, hospitals never collapsed, outside of a tiny number of places they never came close to collapsing – at least not from an influx of patients,” he concluded.

Carlson’s view that the lockdowns should now be lifted because the virus wasn’t as deadly as first feared is noteworthy because at the beginning of the crisis, he wasn’t one to take coronavirus lightly.

As we highlighted back in mid-March, Carlson reportedly drove to Mar-a-Lago to warn President Trump that the coronavirus outbreak was a massive threat and urged him to take it more seriously.",FAKE

648,WHO CLAIMS U.S. AND BRAZIL IGNORED WARNINGS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS,"Despite amplifying Chinese propaganda that there was no “human to human” transmission of coronavirus on January 14, a WHO spokesperson today claimed that the U.S. and Brazil ignored warnings about COVID-19.

World Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris was asked during a press conference today about “high case loads” in Brazil and the U.S.

“Around the world we have seen that the warnings we put out right from the start, very, very early on, were not seen as warnings about a very serious, lethal disease,” said Harris.

However, as we highlighted last month, the WHO blocked doctors from urging countries to impose border controls to stop the spread of coronavirus and repeatedly told countries not to close borders, despite this being an effective way of controlling the spread of the virus

In other words, while accusing Brazil and the U.S. of ignoring warnings, the WHO literally ignored the warnings of its own doctors.

Right up until the end of February, the WHO continued “to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks,” despite the rapid spread of the disease.

A Mount Sinai study found that New York City’s record-high coronavirus cases and deaths were “predominately” due to travel from Europe, meaning that many more lives could have been saved if borders had been closed down earlier.

But instead, the WHO insisted that maintaining the globalist principle of the international traffic of people was more important than stopping a global pandemic.

At every step of the way, the WHO praised China’s actions on coronavirus, despite widespread evidence that the virus was leaked from a lab, that Beijing lied about the true fatality numbers and had known about coronavirus at least weeks before it informed the WHO.

On January 14th, the WHO amplified Chinese government propaganda that there had been no “human to human transmission” of COVID-19, despite this having actually occurred back in November.

According to sources who told Fox News that the virus was leaked from a lab in Wuhan, this represented the “costliest government coverup of all time” and “the World Health Organization (WHO) was complicit from the beginning in helping China cover its tracks.”

Over the weekend it was also revealed that German intelligence agency BND has uncovered evidence that Chinese leader Xi Jinping asked WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to “suppress news about the Wuhan coronavirus” and that he agreed to do so.

While these studies are ongoing, doctors are scrambling to make treatment decisions for severely ill COVID-19 patients based on limited, anecdotal evidence on safety and efficacy. This uncertainty is prompting some questions about whether pharmacogenetics may be useful in helping guide treatment decisions, perhaps by identifying those who might respond particularly well to a drug, or alternatively, by flagging patients who may be at risk for life-threatening adverse events because of genetic factors or other drugs they might be taking. Specifically, since some of the most talked about and controversial drugs being tried for COVID-19 carry the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death, experts believe there may be a role for PGx testing in identifying patients who are already genetically predisposed to such adverse events with drugs they're taking. Knowing this information in advance, they said, could help physicians make more informed treatment choices. For experimental COVID-19 treatment modalities where there may not be clear evidence of a drug/gene interaction, experts hope that the ongoing drug studies in which researchers are exploring the role of biomarkers will yield more definitive data. Ultimately, however, the real utility of PGx testing may not be in helping guide treatments for COVID-19, some predict, but as a supportive tool during the mental health pandemic that will follow. Managing risks Houda Hachad, CSO of precision medicine developer Translational Software, said there's the potential that PGx testing could help avoid drug-drug-gene interactions with hydroxychloroquine, which is currently approved to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. This drug, however, is known to cause arrhythmias in patients with existing cardiovascular disease, who also happen to be at increased risk for COVID-19. This week, a panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommended that doctors not prescribe hydroxychloroquine together with the antibiotic azithromycin — a combination promoted by President Donald Trump — because of the risk of sudden cardiac death and QTc prolongation, a heart rhythm disorder that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and Heart Rhythm Society have cautioned the same. The expert groups recommend closely monitoring the heart rhythms of patients on these drugs, and if possible, avoiding other QTc prolonging therapies. Hachad noted that when patients are evaluated for the risk for QTc prolongation, physicians use a scoring system that factors in the QTc prolonging drugs they're already taking. PGx testing can be helpful in this context, by identifying individuals with certain CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 genotypes that place them at increased risk for cardiac events if they are already on a long list of frequently prescribed drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists several of the drugs that carry the risk of QTc prolongation in its recently published ""Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations."" According to this table, individuals who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers are at greater risk than normal metabolizers for QTc prolongation if they are receiving the antidepressant citalopram. Based on expert guidelines and FDA prescribing label information, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers should receive a lower dose of the drug. Citalopram was the 26th most prescribed drug in the U.S., with more than 24 million scripts written in 2017. If a patient who metabolizes CYP2C19 poorly was on citalopram and also received hydroxychloroquine, it could compound their risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. According to Hachad, there are numerous other examples like this where PGx information can help doctors more accurately gauge patients' cumulative risk for QT prolongation when considering whether to treat a COVID-19 patient with a drug combination like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. An app to inform the public In the process of writing a review on drugs that are currently being tried for COVID-19, pharmacogenetics expert Howard McLeod noted that there was no place for the general public to input the drugs they are on and educate themselves about the potential drug/gene, drug/drug, or drug/disease interactions they may be at risk for if they became infected with the virus and had to go on an experimental therapy. Meanwhile, demand for hydroxychloroquine has surged despite a lack of evidence supporting its use in COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials. Amid the hype and politics around this drug, one of McLeod's colleagues was wondering whether to use hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis and entered the drug into a medication management app called Pharmazam. It revealed that since he was already on an antifungal fluconazole, he would be at risk for long QT syndrome if he took hydroxychloroquine. In terms of the PGx interactions the app may flag that may be of interest in the context of the pandemic, Taimour Langaee CSO of biotech firm Pharmazam highlighted that polymorphisms in ABCC1 and SLCO1B1 transporters, and G6PD, are known to cause adverse effects from hydroxychloroquine. Additionally, with antiviral drugs, such as ritonavir and lopinavir, which are also being tried for COVID-19, there are transporters, as well as CYP450 and glucuronidation variants, that may impact response. Using pharmacogenetics to guide treatment choice, on the other hand, has had a hard slog in terms of gaining acceptance in mainstream medical circles. Many doctors have resisted incorporating information from PGx testing into their day-to-day workflows, except in very limited circumstances where there is a risk of a life-threatening adverse event. There is still differing views in medical circles regarding the utility of PGx testing to dose warfarin or clopidogrel, despite guidelines and FDA labeling supporting testing. Physician reluctance continues to be an issue in the adoption of PGx testing, McLeod acknowledged, adding that ""the healthcare system needs to be ready in order to get the full benefits of this sort of application."" Additionally, while doctors are trying to treat patients in an emergent crisis, pharmacogenetics may not be top of mind, and likely to be ignored when there is unclear messaging from health regulators about when to test patients for PGx variants that may be at issue with experimental COVID-19 drugs. For example, the FDA-approved labels for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine state that these drugs should be prescribed with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency, since they may be at increased risk for hemolytic anemia — where the body breaks down red blood cells faster than it can replenish them. However, the FDA labels don't explicitly recommend PGx testing. Similarly, when the FDA put out a fact sheet for healthcare providers about the emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine, the agency noted that hemolytic anemia has been seen in G6PD-deficient patients, but again, doesn't provide any guidance on testing. Advancing research ""There does seem to be some mixed messaging about G6PD"" deficiency and hydroxychloroquine, noted Michelle Whirl-Carrillo, director of PharmGKB, an online knowledgebase of expertly curated information on the role of genetic variants on drug response. PharmGKB recently launched an online COVID-19 resource to help identify drug-drug interactions. The webpage lists the drugs involved in COVID-19 trials and which of those have PGx information within PharmGKB, and notes the drugs associated with long QT syndrome. There is also a listing of genes implicated in drug adverse events and metabolism, as well as the genes involved in allowing SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry and infection. The bolus of drug and genomics research occurring during the pandemic is an opportunity to assess whether there is a role for genetics in personalizing COVID-19 treatment. Teri Klein, a principal investigator for PharmGKB, estimated there are more than 6,000 COVID-19 related peer-reviewed papers that have been published in the couple of months since the pandemic started. ""In the next month or so, we really will have a much better understanding of a number of these drugs,"" Klein said, noting that many of the experimental drug studies have rapidly enrolled and are expecting readouts on efficacy and safety relatively quickly. ""In clinical trials, often you have a hard time getting a cohort,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, given the circumstances, we don't have difficulty getting people to sign up for these experimental treatments."" Within Pharmazam's COVID19 PGx Project, experts are hoping to learn more about the pharmacogenetics of drugs being tried for COVID-19 and exploring the genetic factors that might make an individual more susceptible to infection and to experiencing severe symptoms. Particularly of interest within the project are ACE2 and TMPRSS2, genes that play role in allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter a cell and infect it. Other research teams are also studying these genes and have already identified certain ACE2 polymorphisms that appear to make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Kristine Ashcraft, former CEO of YouScript, a medication management decision support tool provider, believes that the broader value proposition for PGx as a tool to keep patients out of the emergency room and hospitals is particularly relevant during this pandemic. Studies show patients who get genetic testing are less likely to end up in the emergency room or hospital for a serious adverse event. Managing the mental health pandemic While researchers are working to advance drugs to treat COVID-19 and vaccines to give people immunity against the virus, the mental health impact of the pandemic will also have to be managed. This is where PGx testing may be most useful, experts in the field said. ""It is worthwhile to consider not just the utility of PGx in preventing hospitalization or changing the course of COVID-19 care,"" but also the impact it could have on managing ""the burden on the patients that do survive a COVID-19 infection … [and] those that are suffering from the isolation of social distancing, as well as the financial hardships,"" said David Thacker, a clinical pharmacogenetics content specialist at Translational Software. According to a recent JAMA editorial, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, there was a greater incidence of post-traumatic stress syndrome and psychological distress among patients and doctors. In communities impacted by Hurricane Ike in 2008, around 5% of individuals met the criteria for major depressive disorder, while one in 10 adults in New York City had symptoms of the disorder after 9/11. ""In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears likely that there will be substantial increases in anxiety and depression, substance use, loneliness, and domestic violence; and with schools closed, there is a very real possibility of an epidemic of child abuse,"" wrote Sandro Galea from Boston University School of Public Health, Raina Merchant from the Perelman School of Medicine, and Nicole Lurie from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations in Norway. A survey in March by the American Psychiatric Association found that more than a third of polled individuals said that the pandemic was seriously impacting their mental health, nearly half said they were scared about getting the virus, and 62% said they feared a loved one would get it. Meanwhile, calls to substance abuse and mental health help lines increased eightfold from February to March. As the pandemic continues, people may increasingly turn to medications to deal with the psychological wounds left by the pandemic. Drugs to treat mental health conditions, including major depressive disorder, are some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the U.S., but they're also highly variable and associated with unwanted side effects. As such, one of the main areas where PGx testing has seen uptake is for personalizing psychiatry drugs. Myriad Genetics recently published a meta-analysis involving more than 1,500 patients with major depressive disorder who were enrolled in four studies, which showed that patients who received treatment based on PGx information had significantly better outcomes than those who did not. Although PGx testing in psychiatry is not without its naysayers, doctors may reach for such testing if the use of mental health drugs increases during or after the pandemic. Genomind, a mental health-focused PGx testing company, recently took a number of steps to make it easier for physicians to deliver psychiatric care during the pandemic. Doctors can order Genomind's PGx test and send a saliva collection kit to patient's homes, which can then be mailed to the lab for analysis. Through Genomind, doctors also have access to Sharecare's HIPAA-compliant telemedicine platform for free until September, which they can use to remotely see patients and discuss PGx test results, if ordered. ""The utility of PGx during the COVID-19 crisis is more important than ever,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""This service is helping enable critical mental health treatment during the pandemic and Genomind is doing its best to enable as many mental health professionals as possible.""",FAKE

“What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.” — A Proverb
Here is this week’s question. What do they call us in Guatemala? Hint: It has something to do with China. Here is something else that has to do with China.
On April 18, 2020, during the trump’s daily maunderings through the forest of his ignorance, he indulged his ambivalence towards the country presided over by his good friend, President Xi Jinping, going down the self-congratulatory path which is the only path he follows during these outings. Addressing Covid-19, and its entry into the United States, he reminded those in attendance that he “cut off China very early. And if I didn’t we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe. . . .How would I know to do that? . . .People knew that some bad things were going on, and they got off to a late start. . . . but we cut off China. If we didn’t cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble. And we cut it off.”
That was, of course, not the trump’s first self-admiring description of his actions. It was one of his daily dozens. On March 25 he proudly proclaimed that: “We’re the ones that gave the great response, and we’re the ones that kept China out of here. And if I didn’t do it, you’d have thousands and thousands of people who’ve died-that are now living and happy.” That was the trump version. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, on January 21 it announced the first travel related case of the virus in the United States. It took the trump 10 days to impose limits on travel from China into the United States.
Enhancing the blame-game of which the trump is clearly the all-time champion, in his self-promotional appearance on April 18th he gave vent to the idea that perhaps China intentionally caused the outbreak of the virus saying: “Let’s see what happens with their investigation. But we’re doing investigations also. If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, then there should be consequences.” Continuing his rambling he said: “Our relationship with China was good until they did this. The question was asked, ‘would you be angry at China?’ Well the answer might very well be a very resounding yes, but it depends: was it a mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately? There’s a big difference between those two.” The trump got that right. Ask Alejandro Giammattei. He is the president of Guatemala. Guatemala has been the beneficiary of the trump policies.
According to a report in the New York Times on April 19, 2020, the trumpsters have been engaged in aggressive immigration enforcement, deporting thousands to their home countries. Among those being deported were many infected with Covid-19. On April 20 it was reported that among the illegal immigrants being deported who were infected with Covid-19, were a number who had been sent back to Guatemala.
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT
 But your generosity is crucial to our survival.
On April 13, 44 migrants on a flight from Brownsville Texas to Guatemala tested positive for the virus. On another trumpload of migrants flown into Guatemala from Trumpville, 12 individuals were affected with the virus. On another flight 75% of the passengers were infected.
The United States imposes restrictions on people entering the United States to insure that they are not infected with Covid-19. It does not impose the same restrictions on those it is deporting from the United States into other countries. In the trumpeyed view of the world, it’s OK for the United States to send people infected with Covid-19 into other countries, but it’s not OK for people from foreign countries to enter the United States with that same infection.
Before the trumpian sponsored influx of infected people into that country, Guatemala was already struggling with the effects of Covid-19. As of April 17 there were 235 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, and 35 deaths were related to the virus. Ten per cent of the confirmed cases were persons seeking refuge in the United States who had been sent back to Guatemala by the trump.
In a speech on April 17th, President Giammattei adopted the approach taken by the trump with respect to planes arriving in the United States from China. He said no more deportation flights would be allowed to enter Guatemala until the United States could offer assurances that the passengers on the flights were free of the coronavirus.

975,COVID-19 pandemic costing Ohio colleges millions,"The coronavirus pandemic has cost Ohio’s colleges hundreds of millions of dollars already. As uncertainty looms about fall semester, many colleges are exploring budget reductions and personnel cuts.
As uncertainty over fall semesters looms, the coronavirus pandemic already has cost Ohio colleges hundreds of millions of dollars, sparking conversations about hiring freezes, possible furloughs and other budget reduction measures.
The COVID-19 crisis has cost Ohio’s 14 public universities between $290 million and $310 million this fiscal year, said Bruce Johnson, president of the Inter-University Council of Ohio, an association of the state’s public universities. That includes a combined $171 million in refunds to students, primarily for room and board costs and some fees. Ramping up of online learning has also accounted for costs.
Colleges and universities are still considering what these financial ramifications will mean for them and how they might respond.

“They’re looking at paring down their staffs first, to respond to what we think is a pretty traumatic new normal,” Johnson said.
There is also lost revenue for such things as renting out campus space for conferences and summer camps, he said.
Ohio State University’s housing, dining and recreational fee refunds totaled more than $35 million, and the university expects continued volatility related to investment returns, Michael Papadakis, senior vice president of business and finance and chief financial officer at OSU, said in a written statement.
For the next fiscal year, Ohio State has asked all colleges and units to prepare three budget scenarios: assuming 5%, 10% and 20% reductions in spending.
“We must prepare for fiscal 2021 based on the possibility of ongoing disruptions while continuing to focus on the university’s core academic mission and placing Ohio State in the best possible position for a future in which the virus is contained,“ Papadakis said.
Ohio State has already enacted a hiring freeze, which is expected to save $4 million to $6 million through June 30, and paused certain salary increases, which could save the university $5 million to $10 million. OSU also has paused a number of capital projects.
As the university envisions various budget scenarios, the OSU chapter of American Association of University Professors called last week for transparency in financial planning, with a focus on teaching and research. Members also asked that budget decisions prioritize people such as adjunct faculty and graduate students who aren’t protected by tenure.
“The most vulnerable shouldn’t pay for the budget crisis,” said Pranav Jani, an AAUP board member and an associate professor of English.
Meanwhile, the University of Cincinnati announced earlier this month hiring and salary freezes, spending cuts and pay cuts to the university’s leadership team.
And last week, University of Akron President Gary Miller asked the athletics department and all non-academic administrative divisions to present plans for reducing expenditures by 20%. He also asked university leaders to present a plan to reorganize the academic division and reduce the number of colleges and programs.
Private colleges are also game-planning for financial struggles. Urbana University announced last week that it will close after this semester, due to ongoing enrollment challenges and the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
C. Todd Jones, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of Ohio, doesn’t expect more Ohio private colleges to close in the short term, but he said hiring freezes are already in place at many, and other cuts are likely coming.
“As this continues, colleges are having to look at potential furloughs because when you look at what does college cost, colleges costs are driven by people,” Jones said.
Ohio Wesleyan University is projecting a $2.9 million deficit for this fiscal year ending June 30 and had already forecast another $7.5 million deficit for 2020-2021, thanks in part to construction debt, OWU spokesman Cole Hatcher said in a written statement. But because of the pandemic, next year’s projected deficit has increased to a worst-case scenario of $11 million to $12 million.
The private liberal arts college in Delaware, Ohio, already was reviewing ways to cut costs, Hatcher said. Those efforts will continue through the fall and could result in consolidating work, updating technology, and some job cuts and early retirement options, he said.
Federal relief arrives, but state cuts loom
The federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed last month included billions in aid for higher education. Ohio institutions received a combined $388 million among its public and private colleges, community colleges, career academies, technical schools, adult education centers and cosmetology schools.
Half of the funds must go to students through emergency grants, while universities may use the other half to cover costs associated with the coronavirus.
For Ohio’s public colleges, the federal aid totaled nearly $200 million, with $100 million going to students for emergency relief. The other nearly $100 million doesn’t cover the full losses that public universities have suffered due to the pandemic, Johnson said.
As the federal aid comes in, Ohio colleges are bracing for cuts at the state level. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked state agencies to prepare to make cuts of up to 20% as state tax revenues fall due to lost jobs and closed businesses.
DeWine has not yet announced details about possible cuts, but Johnson said public colleges are concerned about cuts to the State Share of Instruction, Ohio’s primary mechanism for subsidizing instructional costs.
“We’d be extremely concerned if we lost the already $290 million and then on top of that, the state were forced to cut higher education,” Johnson said.
Private colleges, meanwhile, don’t receive that direct state support, but they worry about state cuts to need-based financial aid for students, such as the Ohio College Opportunity Grant, which recently saw an increase in funding.
What’s to come
The future is murky as colleges try to plan for autumn.
“I would call it apprehensive,” Jones said of the outlook for fall semesters. “Because our colleges do not know what’s going to transpire, and yet they need to be prepared for a variety of different scenarios of what could happen.”
Currently, the state’s public universities are planning for students and faculty to be back on campus come fall, but they are also planning for other outcomes, Johnson said.
Ohio State’s AAUP asked the university for “timely notice” of changes for the fall term.
“It’s not possible to know too much in advance, but to have a couple or three game plans that might play out” would be helpful, said AAUP board member and OSU associate professor of English Jill Galvan, noting that faculty, staff and students should be involved in the decision-making.
There’s no set timeline or date by which public colleges plan to make a decision about the fall, Johnson said, and each university will handle decisions on its own.
“We certainly want to give parents and students good information in May,” he said. “That’s our goal.""
If students aren’t back on campus this fall, private universities will struggle, Jones said.
“If this pandemic continues and colleges are not able to reopen their dorms and resume some semblance of normal enrollment this fall, that could endanger a number of campuses,” he said.

479,"Biolidics unlikely to be affected by allegations against Covid-19 test kit distributor, say directors,","The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has queried Catalist-listed Biolidics over its appointment of a scandal-hit company as an exclusive distributor for rapid Covid-19 antibody test kits.
But the company's board of directors replied in a filing on Sunday night (April 26) that it does not expect a material impact on its business plans from its agreement with Nasdaq-listed Aytu Bioscience .
""The company will continue to monitor publicly available information on Aytu and will take appropriate steps to mitigate any potential negative financial impact on Biolidics arising from such developments,"" it said, without going into details on what these steps are.
Biolidics, a cancer diagnostics firm, was asked how it came to pick Denver-based Aytu to distribute its rapid test kits for novel coronavirus antibodies last week.
The SGX also asked what the financial impact could be to Biolidics from ongoing probes into claims that Aytu supplied healthcare providers with coronavirus tests from unapproved Chinese manufacturers and may have breached United States securities laws.
Biolidics said that it was introduced to Aytu by a Denver-based business associate in end-March and was aware of media reporting on the alleged distribution of unauthorised test kits.
Still, it went ahead with its distributorship agreement on April 23 because it believed, after carrying out due diligence such as an assessment of Aytu's financial standing and track record, that the company would be a suitable distributor for its own coronavirus test kits.
Biolidics said that it has not verified the claims or sought legal advice in the United States, but added law firms' probes of Aytu ""may be considered 'attorney advertising'"" under US rules.
""While the company is not privy to the grounds of investigation of potential claims on behalf of purchasers of Aytu against Aytu, the company believes that it would not be impacted by news on such investigation,"" said Biolidics.
It noted that it can appoint another distributor if a contractual minimum purchase quantity is not met, or immediately terminate the agreement if terms are breached by Aytu or sub-distributors.
Separately, the board told the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), or Sias, that an executive's remark about commissioning some two million test kits in two months ""was referring to the intended build-up in inventory in anticipation of orders for the test kits and not firm orders"".

""The decision on the order volume by the company in the next two months will be dependent on the sales volume as well as availability of capital and human resources.""
To another question from Sias, on how Biolidics adds value to test kits that are made by a Chinese supplier in Nanjing, the company said that ""such information is commercially sensitive"".
""The disclosure of such information may negatively impact the competitive strength of the company,"" it asserted, while clarifying that the test kits do not make use of Biolidics' patented technology to extract tumour cells from small amounts of blood.
Biolidics reiterated to shareholders that it ""is actively developing the market for the test kits"" in Singapore, the Philippines, the European Union and the US, and seeking regulatory approval elsewhere, although it also specified that it has not submitted any application to Indonesia.
Biolidics shares saw rapid price swings last week after the announcement of the agreement with Aytu, which it said will likely contribute positively to its revenue for the year to Dec 31.

The Maui Police Department had resorted to Facebook to carry out a manhunt for a young woman who was suspected of breaching social distancing as local authorities scramble to prevent the further spread of the deadly coronavirus.

On the police department’s Facebook page, as they searched for the suspect, they wrote: Police are requesting your assistance in locating Tara Trunfio. Trunfio is wanted for violating the Rules and Orders for failure to quarantine. Trunfio is described as a 24 year old, Caucasian female, height 5’11”, weight 155 lbs., with brown hair and hazel eyes. She was last seen in Haiku, and may now be in the Kihei area. Anyone with information is asked to please contact the Maui Police Department.

On May 16, the department issued an update to the original post notifying social media users that the social distancing fugitive was remanded in police custody, thanking them for their assistance.

The update read:

On May 16, 2020 at about 2:31 a.m., Tara Trunfio (23) of Colorado, was arrested for two (2) counts of Rules and Orders.

Investigation reveals that Trunfio arrived on Maui, acknowledged the Emergency Proclamations set forth by Governor David Ige and Mayor Michael Victorino with regards to the Traveler 14 Day Quarantine, however failed to comply.

The Maui Police Department went onto add:

An all-points bulletin was put out for her arrest, and posted to social media. There were over 300,000 people reached with the post and over 5,000 comments, some positive and some negative.

On May 16, 2020 at about 1:40 a.m., police were dispatched to a residence in Kula, regarding a female later identified as Trunfio, on the property refusing to leave.

Maui Police Department will continue to enforce the rules and orders set forth by the Governor of the State of Hawaii, Mayor of Maui County, and Hawaii Revised Statutes.

Trunfio’s bail is set at $4,000.00. She remains in police custody as of May 16, 2020 at 9:45 a.m.

The updated Facebook post, which has gone viral after being shared nearly 3,000 times, was not tremendously well-received by its 8,000+ commenters.

Most of the people who viewed the post voiced their disapproval of the measures taken by the Police Department.

The Police Department was compared to totalitarian mid-20th century political regimes.

Across the pond, in the UK, the police have come under immense fire after several different images have circulated social media showing potential overreach.

One man had his front door kicked in after reports that he was hosting a party–thereby breaching social distancing–had emerged. With a gung-ho attitude, the police, failing to wear any protective gear, cavalierly charged into the lone man’s apartment as he filmed them searching the premises for non-existent revelers.

During a confrontation with the police, a defiant but innocent man wasthreatened to have charges made up by police in order to bring him in. The video went viral on social media and the Police Department responsible was forced to suspend the officer in question and to issue a statement.",FAKE
377,VIDEO: WOMAN DRIVEN OUT OF GROCERY STORE BY ANGRY MOB FOR NOT WEARING A MASK,"Video: Woman Driven Out of Grocery Store by Angry Mob For Not Wearing a Mask
Video footage out of Staten Island shows a woman being driven out of a grocery store by an angry mob because she’s not wearing a mask.

The clip shows the woman surrounded by other shoppers as they yell and cuss at her.

“Get the fuck outta here” and “get out” the crowd screams at the woman while pointing towards the exit. “The viral video is part of a wave of social shaming on Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites, aimed at people not wearing face masks in public places,” reports Newsweek.

New Yorkers have been required to wear masks inside grocery stores and while using public transport since April 17.

Reaction to the video was mixed, with some decrying the actions of the mob but others vehemently supporting their behavior.

“Cool. Finally. Cuz at this point, a maskless person in an indoor place is like a shooter pointing his gun at me,” commented one respondent.

“Not wearing a mask during a pandemic is like not wearing a seatbelt in a car,” claimed another.

As we highlighted earlier, in Italy the left-wing government has announced it will recruit 60,000 citizen snitches to enforce “social distancing.”

In the United States, it looks like that won’t be necessary, as an army of volunteer Karens are willing to perform the same role for free.",FAKE
253,11-year-old girl in serious condition with COVID-19,"An 11-year-old girl with the novel coronavirus was put on a ventilator Sunday, making her the youngest person in Israel in serious condition with the disease.
The girl, from Tiberias, was brought to the northern city’s Poriya Medical Center on Friday with a high fever, vomiting, and a lack of appetite, Hebrew media reported. Since then her condition has deteriorated and on Sunday she was moved to the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa where doctors decided to sedate her and attach her to a ventilator.

The girl had been staying with her family at the Kinar Galilee Hotel in Tiberias, which has been commissioned by the state as a coronavirus quarantine center.
Channel 13 television news reported that the girl’s father is accompanying her as she receives medical treatment, though he has also been diagnosed with the virus.
Previously, the youngest person in Israel to require ventilation due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, was 19 years old.
Last week a baby born prematurely to a woman infected with the coronavirus died. The baby, along with her twin sister, was being treated at the neonatal intensive care unit in Tiberias after their mother gave birth the week before. The hospital said the twins were tested twice for COVID-19 and both sets of tests came back negative.
As of Sunday, at least 200 people have died of the virus in Israel and 100 were on ventilators, according to Health Ministry figures. There have been 15,398 cases diagnose and 6,602 have recovered from the disease.",FAKE

529,"Beaumont COVID-19 antibody test of staff reveals 20% were positive, asymptomatic ","Beaumont COVID-19 antibody test of staff reveals 20% were positive, asymptomatic .  COVID-19 antibody testing of staff at the Beaumont Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center has revealed that 20% of those tested positive were asymptomatic of the virus, according to a press release Sunday from UMass Memorial Medical Center.
The staff voluntarily underwent the testing for the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of 80 staff members tested, 16 tested positive.
The Beaumont facility is now a temporary COVID-19 care and treatment center.
Those findings likely mean the caregivers had a mild infection from coronavirus and were able to mount an immune response against it, or may have previously been infected with a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2, the press release said.
All caregivers at the facility will be informed of their test results by phone or mail this week. In addition to informing the caregivers of their results, the letter will also remind caregivers — whether testing positive or negative — to not change their behavior because of their individual results and to continue to exercise standard infection control precautions while at work, outside of work, and in their homes.
Typically, immune responses to a virus confer some degree of protection from being infected from the same virus again though there is not enough information to know if this is the case with COVID-19. Antibody testing is frequently used to understand what percentage of a population has been exposed to a virus.
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in hard hit areas of the U.S., such as in Chelsea outside Boston, where 30 percent of people who were tested were found to be positive for antibodies, and New York state — where 16% tested positive — were random samples and not specifically focused on health care workers, the press release said.
“Understanding the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is an important tool in our fight against COVID-19. We are so grateful to the Beaumont staff for being the first skilled nursing facility in the state to dedicate itself to caring for COVID-19 patients,” said Eric W. Dickson MD, President and CEO of UMMHC the provider of the testing. “Without them, we would not be able to keep up with the number of patients we are caring for with COVID-19. It seemed only fitting to offer them the opportunity to be tested first.”
UMass Memorial intends to offer free testing to some of its caregivers as increased testing capacity becomes available. SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is currently available locally at CareWell Urgent Care Centers.",FAKE
986,Holistic Tips For Building A Stronger Immune System Against Covid-19,"Since I was a little girl I’ve been a die hard fanatic of fried chicken, I mean I could literally eat it everyday, not quite sure what the high in cholesterol, oily,magic meat did for me but but boy did it do it!! Even as a vegetarian today smelling the hypnotic smell of its potent fragrance, with in conjunction to the sound of its sizzling patterns from the frying pan can send me straight into a frenzy storming out the front of any kitchen door in extreme frustration, weak in temptation, and fully engaged in a conscious battle between the unhealthy devil on the left side of my shoulder and the little angel full of life and vitality on the right.
Nonetheless, in today’s time I’ve more so been wondering why haven’t so many other minorities and people with comprised immunity’s haven’t switched over to a meatless diet with less salt and starch? Especially with the media constantly announcing the heightened risk of limited survival of Covid-19 for those with comprised or weak immune systems. There are a number of things we can do to boost our immunity, one that doesn’t get a lot of widespread media is fasting, fasting rebuilds and regenerates cells, fasting adds years on your life, fasting also detoxify’s the body and blood, and is also known for curing and riding the body of all kinds of illness’es and diseases. I’m going on my second year of fasting, some would call my methods of fasting extreme as I like to fast generally twice a month on periods of 5 day increments. If you find this to be a bit much (because it is in the beginning) I definitely had my fair share of trail and errors, you can try intermediate fasting, which one example is leaving a 8 hour window open for meals with hours consisting of 1 pm -9 pm and using the rest of the 16 hours of your day to fast. The beautiful thing about fasting is it’s versatility, you can incorporate any type of method to your fast you’d like!
Also, another great tip on building up immunity is incorporating essential oils into your daily regime, eucalyptus, frankincense, and oregano are some of the top essentials oils for reducing inflammation, extensive scientific study’s have found a direct link between Frankincense’s ability to lower inflammation and an enhanced immunity.
Inflammation is just your body’s way of formulating illness. Heart disease, and respiratory infections are all just a over flow of inflammation to those specific parts of the body, even dementia is caused by inflammation in the brain. Eucalyptus might be my fave out of all three, not only does it provide instant relief, but it also provides a soothing calming effect especially good for balancing better sleep patterns. The secret to its effectiveness is a compound called 1, 8-cineole, which has powerful anti-inflammatory, antioxidants, and anti-bacterial properties. Oregano is just as powerful as it is a natural antibiotic, it also lowers cholesterol, and it also known for its ability to prevent cold symptoms from worsening. Balancing a healthy diet full of vitamin c is also in essential in balancing immunity. Believe it or not I haven’t had a cold in close to 4 years! Long before this pandemic I’ve incorporated protecting my hands when touching public doors and gas pumps etc.

887,NOT WORTH MY TIME! TRUMP CANCELS DAILY BRIEFING,"President Donald Trump has declared that the White House news conferences were ‘not worth the time and effort’ because the ‘Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions.’

An embattled Trump took to his favorite social media platform on Saturday to slam ‘fake news’ and to cancel the White House press briefings.

‘What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,’ he asked in the Saturday tweet. ‘They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!’ Trump followed up with a declaration that he never called the pandemic a ‘hoax’ during a rally in South Carolina.

‘I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing? I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax,’ he said. ‘They have been called out & embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!’ Prior to the tweets, the White House called the press pool and announced that the press briefing was cancelled.

360,FBI RAIDS DETROIT-AREA MEDICAL FACILITY ‘FOR USING INTRAVENOUS VITAMIN C TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS’,"The FBI on Thursday raided a Detroit-area medical facility for reportedly treating non-hospitalized coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C, which the FBI appears to be claiming is a “fraudulent treatment.”

Allure Medical Spa, which is owned by Dr. Charles Mok, had been giving out vitamin C injections for free to first responders before the FBI came in and aggressively shut him down. From Click on Detroit, “Macomb County business raided by the FBI over possible improper COVID-19 treatments”:

FBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.

On April 18, Allure’s Facebook page had a post that said “At Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.”

That post, as well as a post on Allure Medical’s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down.

After talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.

Dr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said “What I’m finding in practice — I treat a lot of COVID patients — is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.”

While it may not be a “cure,” vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.

FOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a “fake treatment” and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing “fraudulent treatments for COVID-19” and allegedly “did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.” FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is “ahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients’] health first, often treating them for free.”

“Vitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,” the doctor said.

“I’ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,” one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.

“The FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,” FOX 2 Detroit reported.

Here’s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:

Allure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees

Allure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. “We are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples’ immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,” says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.

Intravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 – Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS – COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.

If you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19.

In addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.

The only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they’re using it to “help those with the virus recover quicker.”

It hasn’t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.

Raiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.

732,“THEY DEMAND UNEMPLOYMENT” – BIZ OWNER SHOCKED AT ANGRY RESPONSE WHEN SHE TELLS STAFF THEIR PAYCHECKS WILL RESUME,"we first introduced the topic of a ‘welfare cliff’ at which more work was punished – i.e. the ‘generosity’ of the package of welfare benefits creates a perverse incentive not to work any harder…

As we wrote at the time, one of the tragedies of America today is that so many adults of sound mind and body do not support themselves and their families. It’s a tragedy not because they suffer material want; indeed, relatively few suffer so, because government assistance satisfies many of their material needs.

It’s tragic because one of the keys to human happiness is earned self-respect, which requires, as Charles Murray has written, making one’s own way in the world. The vast majority of poor people don’t want welfare; they don’t want handouts; they want a good job with which they can support themselves and their families comfortably. The tragedy of the American welfare system is that it traps so many people in dependency on government, by hindering them from getting on and climbing up the job ladder, and thereby earning self-respect and happiness.

*  *  *

Our fear now, confirmed by excellent research from  Kathy Morris & Chris Kolmar at Zippia.com, is that the ‘generosity’ of the CARES Act (and the fact that politicians are loathed to remove any policy that could possibly make their voters upset) has the potential to create an entire new generation of welfare serfs, subsisting on significant welfare benefits with no incentive to ‘get back to work’, even after the lockdowns are lifted.

DoubleLine’s CEO Jeff Gundlach appears to agree… And now, as BizPacReview.com’s Vivek Saxena details below,  a Washington State business owner faced backlash from her employees after she obtained a forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loan from the federal government that has allowed her to keep them fully paid through the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interview with CNBC this week, salon owner Jamie Black-Lewis of the Oasis Medspa & Salon in Woodinville and Amai Day Spa in Bothell said her employees were furious because they were already “making” more money being unemployed.

And the reason they were “making” more being unemployed was because of a Democrat-pushed provision that was added to the CARES Act.

The provision added “a flat $600 a week to the typical weekly benefits paid by one’s state,” CNBC reported. “Those traditional benefits, which vary widely between states, replaced about 40% of one’s prior wages.”

“The measure’s improved $600-a-week payments, which run through July, aim to boost that wage replacement rate to 100% for the average worker. But some, especially lower-wage workers, can come out ahead.”

And that’s exactly what happened in Black-Lewis’s case, just as congressional Republicans had repeatedly warned. “It’s a windfall they see coming,” Black-Lewis said of the unemployment benefits her employees were slated to “earn.”

“In their mind, I took it away. I couldn’t believe it. On what planet am I competing with unemployment?

“It was a firestorm of hatred about the situation,” Black-Lewis said.

On a planet that contains naive Democrats, no doubt …

Included among the many Republicans who spoke out last month against the inclusion of the Democrat-pushed provision were Sens. Rick Scott and Tim Scott.

“We have a virus and we know people can’t work for a variety of reasons,” Rick Scott said at the time.

“We got to help them, but at the moment we go back to work, we cannot create an incentive not to work. We cannot be paying people more money on unemployment than they get paid in their job.”

“[W]e cannot encourage people to make more in unemployment than in employment,” Tim Scott added.

“This legislation would not stop at 100 percent of your income. This legislation would allow people to make more in unemployment than in employment.”

In response to Republicans’ logical rebuttals, congressional Democrats and their left-wing media allies pounced with hysteria and smears: Republicans are more worried about what unemployed & impoverished Americans will do with an extra $600 during a financial crisis than they are with what billion dollar companies will do with billions of dollars with little oversight & no strings attached

— Adam Blickstein (@AdamBlickstein) March 25, 2020 . As the repercussions of the Democrat-pushed measure were becoming more apparent a couple of weeks later in mid-April, Sen. Lindsey Graham warned that it needed to be fixed.

“Here’s the problem: The unemployment benefits in South Carolina are $23/hour to be unemployed,” he said during an appearance on Fox News last week.

“You’ve got a lot of small businesses trying to keep their employees on the payroll paying $16 and $17/hour. One program is undercutting the other. We’ve got to get that fixed.”",FAKE
809,"Mosques becoming major source of COVID-19 transmission in Pak, warns PIMA ","Sudan announces first coronavirus death
Pakistan's top Islamic medical body has warned that mosques are becoming a major source of transmission for the novel coronavirus and urged people to pray at home during Ramzan, as the COVID-19 cases in the country rose to 13,105 on Sunday.
""Mosques are becoming a major source of virus transmission,"" Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) President Dr Iftikhar Burney said on Saturday.
Talking to reporters, Burney said that the infected cases have surged rapidly during the past week.
""Around 6,000 cases for coronavirus surfaced in a month.but the same has doubled in the last six days,"" he said, warning that the infection would further go up in the coming months of May and June.
He said the number of patients in the intensive care units (ICUs) of the public hospitals is increasing at a shocking rate. ""Most of the hospitals in the country are housing more coronavirus patients that those suffering from other diseases, he told reporters.
His remarks comes days after Pakistan's top doctors warned of ""significant mayhem"" and ""fatal outcomes"" if mosques continue to remain open and urged the government to review its decision to allow congregational prayers during the month of Ramzan amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
The Pakistan government early this month succumbed to pressure from the hardline clerics and allowed conditional congregational prayers in mosques during Ramzan.
However, the 20-point agreement signed by the leading clerics with President Arif Alvi on restricting access to mosques during Ramzan was not being followed completely.
Alvi has written a letter to the Imams of mosques urging them to ask worshippers above the age of 50 to pray at home. He pointed out that the point number six of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) set in the agreement said that persons over the age of 50 should avoid offering prayers at the mosque.
Alvi also visited mosques in Rawalpindi to review arrangements made by the administration of mosques to contain the spread of the virus, he wrote in a tweet.
He shared a picture of Jama Masjid Ghousia and said the administration had arranged for Taraweeh (special prayers offered at night during Ramzan), keeping in mind necessary preventative measures to curb the spread. However, the face masks were lacking.
Several countries including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt have stopped congregational prayers in mosques.
In several Arab countries, the 'azaan' (call for prayer) has been amended and now it urges people to pray in their homes.
Advisor on Health Dr Zafar Mirza also took to Twitter and again urged the ""citizens to demonstrate responsibility & avoid congregations during Ramzan to protect themselves from COVID-19."" However, the government was still reluctant to close down the mosques due to fear of backlash by the hardline clerics.

167,Fashion post-Covid-19: is this the end of maximalism?,"The past few years in fashion have given us a lust, bordering on obsession, for all things maximalist.
Be it at Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Moschino or Philipp Plein, decadent layering, opulent finishes and an abundance of bling have dominated the runway, fuelling our insatiable need for ""more"".
But that was before the arrival of the coronavirus. With industries laid waste, countries shuttered and hundreds of thousands of lives lost, the world we all knew has dramatically altered and as we begin cautiously to re-emerge after self-imposed isolation, we are all seeking markers of reassurance, comfort and stability.
Welsh history gave Alexander McQueen its warrior women for autumn / winter 2020. Courtesy McQueen Moving forward, will we crave a return to the decadent hedonism of maximalism? It may be gaudy, indulgent and over the top, but it is ultimately about celebration, about joy and embracing the sheer expressiveness of fashion.
It can be expressed in many ways. Who hasn’t felt the thrill of pulling on a new dress, or unearthing a gilded find at a thrift shop? Who hasn’t longed for something from our grandmother's wardrobe or looked forward to the day we can borrow our mother's vintage boots? And such giddy longing does not make one greedy. Far from it. The thrill of the chase, taking joy and enjoying a moment, are all vital parts of the human condition.
Singers Lady Gaga and Harry Styles, actor Jared Leto and Madonna have all dedicated themselves to being modern-day Lounge Lizards, in preposterous make-up, high-waisted flares and velvet capes, embracing the sheer joy of being alive.
For Gucci autumn / winter 2020, ruffles were restrained with puritanical hats. Courtesy Gucci But even before Covid-19, the ever-faster fashion merry-go-round was drawing complaints that it moved too quickly, burning too fast through designers and precious resources.
In a recent interview with Vogue , Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele said: “I hope we will never go back to that 'normal'. Because the life we lived before has been fearfully unsustainable. So, yes, we will go back to life. But, I hope, to a different life.”
When we finally emerge from our cocoons, will we yearn for the spartan purity of pared-back designers such as Jil Sander and Helmut Lang, whose severity of line better fits the present mood? Or will we want to celebrate, indulge, and announce that we are one of the lucky survivors?
The autumn / winter 2020 collections, which were unveiled just as Covid-19 was starting to spread its full, destructive power, were filled with clothes that spoke of practicality, of utility, of ""hunkering down"" instead of excess and exhibitionism.
A nightmare scenario at Balenciaga for autumn / winter 2020. Balenciaga, for example, gave us clothes for an apocalypse, shown on a flooded runway and under an end-of-days sky, while Marine Serre continued what she had begun so joltingly for spring / summer 2020 (that took place in September 2019) with face masks in what now feels like chilling foresight.
Or how about Prada, with its belted practicality? Simple garb – almost nun like in its simplicity – in stoic grey and tightly held with thick leather belts. Or Alexander McQueen who looked to the folklore of ancient Wales to create clothes for modern warrior women.

Even Louis Vuitton looked back in time, to deliver a collection of space-age history, mixing ruffles of old with technical fabrics.
At Gucci, it, too, was about less. More fancy ruffles were heaped into skirts, but then added to sparse tops, and Puritan hats, that gave it all an air of restraint.
Hindsight is 20/20, as they say, and it is fascinating to reflect on collections unveiled so recently with new perspective, and see that the signs were already there.
We were already beginning to turn away from the glory days of the maximum, shift away from the endless ""new"", and instead, turn towards a sense of ""make do"" and ‘re-wear’. It was already happening. It just took a pandemic for us to see it.

“H ow can he be so stupid?” a dad asked me in a telehealth visit. His voice shook with fear and rage as he described his adolescent son sneaking out to meet friends against legal and family orders to stay at home.
As a child psychiatrist, I’ve been fielding many such calls.
“What if he’s not stupid?” I asked. Youths who ignore orders to shelter in place are cast as insensitive, short sighted, and foolish by media and politicians . But what if adults are missing their logic? What if adolescents and young adults are actually acting according to the American ideals of self-interest and self-sufficiency that have been modeled for them?

Leadership happens by example. Lawmakers and other adults have set very poor examples about acting selflessly to protect vulnerable populations. When nearly 8,000 Americans aged 24 and younger died from gun violence in 2018, youths’ pleas for gun control fell on deaf ears. After nearly 11,000 young American lives were lost to suicide and drug overdoses in 2018, mental health and substance abuse treatment has remained limited and difficult to access. Efforts to reduce climate change, despite urgent pleas to do so , have been sparse.
Related: It was my job to call people whose Covid-19 tests were positive. That taught me a lot about medicine, the law, and society Should young Americans now be asked to protect the older adults who failed to protect them? Is that fair?

If adults expect adolescents and young adults to act in ways we have not demonstrated and modeled for them, we are the stupid and selfish ones. Lawmakers are demanding enormous sacrifices from young Americans: their educations, their social lives, and sometimes their safety, as many of the 1 million abused and neglected American kids are now isolated at home with their abusers, with no plan to ensure their safety.
Young people have low odds of dying from Covid-19. As I write this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 25 Americans aged 24 or younger have died of Covid-19 in 2020, or 0.1% of the lives claimed by suicide and unintentional drug overdoses in this age group in 2018. (For comparison, 477 children and adolescents under age 17 in the United States died of influenza in the 2018-2019 flu season.)
No graduations. No sports. No time with friends. Lonely teenagers are more likely to become depressed, obese, and unhealthy adults. Social isolation in childhood is linked to poor health, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity in adulthood. Even in good times, about 8% of American teens try to kill themselves each year and about 70% suffer from loneliness. In 2020, these numbers will likely be higher .
Is it shocking that some young people see social isolation measures as a more deadly threat than Covid-19? Is it rational?
Our medical system’s insufficient capacity to treat Covid-19 patients is a crisis that needs urgent intervention. Meanwhile, we’ve brushed aside the same medical system’s insufficient capacity to treat the issues threatening the lives of America’s youths for years.
Rationing health care — an issue now in the news in the Covid-19 era — is something I was tasked to do from my first day as a psychiatrist. There were never enough beds in the psychiatric units for young people at risk of death from suicide or addiction. Now, as the need for mental health treatment rises, the pandemic has forced hospitals to further reduce their capacity to treat mental health issues.
All of the teens and young adults I treat have made valiant efforts to isolate themselves to protect others, even knowing that they are extremely unlikely to die from Covid-19. For the first two weeks, they did well. Now they are suffering. Some hit their limits and can’t do it anymore. More teens and young adults tell me this with each passing week. Their restlessness and boredom have morphed into depression, anxiety, and anger.

Quite the opposite. They are shamed in the rare instances when they can’t, or refuse to, sacrifice their own well-being for the greater good. They are shamed for acting like teenagers — and for acting American.
Youths lack voting and spending power, so their voices don’t get heard. I am writing on their behalf because their perspectives matter. They will inherit the leadership of our troubled society and we are foolish not to prioritize their well-being.
While social isolation is necessary to reduce deaths and to keep hospitals functioning, I believe a more nuanced and sophisticated discussion of the risks and benefits to key groups is warranted. If we want our children and teens to help protect us, we must protect them first.

223,NEXT IN CORONAVIRUS TYRANNY: FORCED VACCINATIONS AND ‘DIGITAL CERTIFICATES’,"In my first week in the House of Representatives in 1976, I cast one of the two votes against legislation appropriating funds for a swine flu vaccination program.

A swine flu outbreak was then dominating headlines, so most in DC were frantic to “do something” about the virus.

Unfortunately, the hastily developed and rushed-into-production swine flu vaccine was not only ineffective, it was dangerous.

Approximately 50 people who received the vaccine subsequently contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome, a potentially fatal form of paralysis.

According to an expert with the Centers for Disease Control, the incidence of Guillain-Barré was four times higher among those who received the swine flu vaccine than in the general population.  That sad history may soon repeat itself. Right now, governments and private industries are working to rapidly develop and deploy a coronavirus vaccine. Microsoft founder Bill Gates, who is a major funder of these efforts, has suggested everyone who receives a vaccine be issued a “digital certificate” proving he has been vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose record of wrong predictions makes him the Bill Kristol of epidemiology, also wants individuals to carry some proof they have been vaccinated.

Another authoritarian proposal floated to deal with coronavirus is to force everyone to download a phone app that will track their movements. This would allow government officials to identify those who may have been near anyone who may have had coronavirus. Such mandatory “contact tracing” is an assault on our privacy and liberty.

Vaccines can improve health. For example, vaccines helped reduce the incidence of diseases like polio. But not all vaccines are safe and effective for all people. Furthermore, certain modern practices, such as giving infants multiple vaccines at one time, may cause health problems. The fact that vaccines may benefit some people, or even most people, does not justify government forcing individuals to be vaccinated. It also does not justify vaccinating children against their parents’ wishes. And it certainly does not justify keeping individuals and families in involuntary quarantine because they do not have “digital certificates” proving they have had their shots.

If government can force individuals to receive medical treatment against their will, then there is no reason why government cannot force individuals to buy medical insurance, prohibit them from owning firearms, dictate their terms of employment, and prevent them from taking arguably harmful actions like smoking marijuana or drinking raw milk. Similarly, if government can override parents’ wishes regarding medical treatment for their children, then there is no reason why government cannot usurp parental authority in other areas, such as education.

Proponents of mandatory vaccines and enhanced surveillance are trying to blackmail the American people by arguing that the lockdown cannot end unless we create a healthcare surveillance state and make vaccination mandatory. The growing number of Americans who are tired of not being able to go to work, school, or church, or even to take their children to a park because of government mandates should reject this “deal.” Instead, they should demand an immediate end to the lockdowns and the restoration of individual responsibility for deciding how best to protect their health.",FAKE

",FAKE
18,AMERICA HAS BECOME “THE LAND OF THE SNITCHES” DURING THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC,"For those that wondered if Americans would be willing to report on their neighbors on a widespread basis during a major crisis, you now have your answer.

All over the country, calls have been pouring in to authorities from “concerned citizens” that are quite eager to point a finger at their neighbors for violating the coronavirus lockdowns.

In fact, it has been reported that some very nosy people in the state of California were actually calling 911 to report that their neighbors were coughing inside their own homes. Of course the mainstream media is not exactly helping matters when they use phrases such as “death sentence” to describe this pandemic.

Yes, we should all be taking this virus very seriously, but the truth is that this is not the end of the world and everyone needs to calm down.

Do we really want to have a society where everyone is spying on their neighbors?  When I read that a mother in Wisconsin had been visited by the police because she had permitted her daughter to go play at a friend’s house, it really touched a nerve with me…  A Wisconsin mom videotaped two police officers who showed up at her home and accused her of “allowing” her daughter to play at a friend’s house, an act they deemed to be in defiance of Wisconsin’s “Stay at Home” order.

The officers are clearly agitated and condescending in their conversation with the mother, who is addressed as “Amy” when she opens the door upon their arrival.

So how did the police know that her daughter had gone to another house to play?

Needless to say, someone snitched on her.

And this next story is truly bizarre.  A Colorado woman named Heather Silchia was deeply alarmed when she discovered that her “neighbors” had put a really nasty note on her vehicle…

The missive read, “PLEASE STAY HOME. I noticed a few days a week you leave home with your baby and return a short time later without it. Then I see the man of the house arrive with the baby later in the afternoon while your vehicle hasn’t moved all day. This leads me to believe that the kid is in daycare.”

The letter continued, “Stop. I am assuming that man has an essential job since he is gone all day but if you are home there is no reason for your child to be in daycare at a time like this. I also see you leave shortly after your husband (I assume) gets home. You aren’t wearing any sort of uniform and I have never seen you wear a mask. Bars are closed and you couldn’t possibly be getting groceries every night (which would also require you to wear a mask) so I again ask you to please stay home.”

Well, it turns out that Heather Silchia is actually a 911 dispatcher, and that is why she can’t watch her baby all day.

And we should be thankful for front line workers like her, because they are so greatly needed during a time like this.

Sadly, the examples that I have just shared with you are not isolated incidents.  In fact, it has been revealed that there are hundreds of people that have been snitching on their neighbors in the state of Missouri alone…

Hundreds of people have been exposed for reporting people who have flouted social distancing rules and some are now scared they could receive a backlash. The names and addresses of approximately 900 people in Missouri were released as part of a media request under the Sunshine Law, which allows for the release of information submitted to a public agency (except for wrongdoing and abuse tips).

St. Louis County had urged the community to share details of anyone not following guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic and noted in the terms and conditions that information may be shared publicly. However some people may not have read the small print submitted tips via an online form and email from the end of March. Many had asked for their communications to remain private.

If things are this bad in Missouri, one can only imagine the level of snitching that is happening in New York or California.

And even though some states are starting to gradually lift their “shelter-in-place” orders, the truth is that our society is going to be dealing with “social distancing” for a long time to come.  In fact, the way that we share many of our public spaces is in danger of being permanently redefined…

New designs for eating places. McDonald’s is already prototyping a socially distanced version of its restaurant that could be a template for fast-food spaces around the world.

Checkerboard grids on the grass in parks, with people allowed to occupy one square only if those surrounding it are empty.

Or time-sharing of public places: If you don’t show up for your 12:15 p.m. slot at the playground, you’re out of luck.

Are you kidding me?

Of course snitches will have a field day in this sort of an environment.  If you sit too close to a snitch in church or you walk too closely behind a snitch on the sidewalk, you may find yourself explaining your actions to the police.

And what is truly tragic is that none of this nonsense is even necessary.  Please take two and a half minutes and watch this video from Dr. Eric Berg.  It is the most important video about this pandemic that I have watched by a wide margin. After watching the video, I think that you will understand why all of the coronavirus lockdowns should be ended as soon as possible.

Yes, this virus spreads incredibly easily.  But a lot of the people that catch it never show any symptoms at all, and it has become clear that there are things that we can do for those that do become sick to prevent a lot of the really severe cases.

Unfortunately, the mainstream media is not going to tell you the truth.  Instead, they are just going to keep telling you that the death toll projections are going up and that everyone should continue to stay home.

Look, the reality of the matter is that most of the population is eventually going to be exposed to this virus no matter if we have lockdowns or not.  So it is very important to be taking your vitamins and to be doing whatever you can to support your immune system.  And it is also very important to understand that this is not even close to the worst thing that we are going to face.

If we can’t even handle COVID-19, and if the mainstream media won’t even share the truth when scientific studies show absolutely amazing results, what is going to happen to our society when a really severe crisis comes along?",FAKE
989,Covid-19: We’ll Deal With Illegal Immigrants ,"Foreigners who enter into Ghana within this period when the country’s borders have been closed will severely be dealt with together with their Ghanaian accomplices.
This was announced by President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo on Sunday, April 26, 2020, when he addressed the nation on measures put in place to curb the spread of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Ghana.
He observed that despite the closures of the borders, some immigrants are able to enter the country illegally. He said most of these people are noted to be carriers of COVID-19.
President Nana Akufo-Addo gave the warning after reports emerged that 17 out of 67 passengers who were intercepted near Nkwanta by officers of the Immigration Service and other security personnel recently for illegally entering the region from Accra during the period of the lockdown, tested positive for COVID-19.
The President in his eight COVID-19 address on Sunday 26th April 2020 expressed his displeasure over how “a few Ghanaians are aiding some West African nationals to enter our country [Ghana] illegally, despite the closure of our borders.”
He warned that “not only will persons who enter our country illegally be strictly dealt with, but so will Ghanaians who facilitate their entry.”
“These are unpatriotic acts and must stop. We cannot continue to allow a few persons, who are motivated by their own selfish, money-making interests, to endanger the lives of the rest of the population.”
The president further called on Ghanaians to be each others keeper during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The President had earlier closed the country’s borders indefinitely as part of measures to fight the Coronavirus.

Ghana’s COVID-19 cases have increased to 1,550 as of Sunday, April 26, 2020.

102,"COVID-19 likely spread by building ventilation, say Canadian researchers working on an HVAC fix","The outbreak of COVID-19 at a restaurant in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou was a puzzle.
The suspected index patient was a visitor from the coronavirus’s epicentre in Wuhan. But the eight other customers who later tested positive were not sitting close enough for droplet transmission, and most of the patrons and staff avoided infection altogether.
A team of local scientists eventually came to an eye-opening conclusion about the episode: tiny particles of virus had hitched a ride on currents created by the eatery’s air-conditioning.
For a group of civil engineers at the University of Alberta, the finding was no surprise. In their world, they say, it’s well known that building ventilation systems are efficient discriminators of virus and other pathogens, and believe the COVID-19 bug is no exception.
Aided by a $440,000 federal-government grant , they’re now working on ways that buildings could change their HVAC set-ups to curb the risk of infection, what the researchers call a “non-pharmaceutical” intervention against the disease.
We want to save lives, let’s cut right to the chase
“We want to save lives, let’s cut right to the chase,” said Prof. Brian Fleck, part of the project. “There are so many, many, many buildings … This effects absolutely everybody. Billions of people. If we are able to cut down the transmission rate by a per cent, that’s a lot of people.”
The engineers’ belief in the importance of building ventilation as a transmitter of the COVID-19 virus is not universally held.
The World Health Organization and other public-health bodies , citing the science to date, say the pathogen is spread almost entirely by droplets, heavier particles emitted mostly when infected people cough or sneeze, and which fall down within a short distance. Hence the two-metre rule for social distancing.
“The HVAC systems in most non-medical buildings play only a small role in infectious disease transmission, including COVID-19,” argued the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers last month.
But Chinese and Australian air-quality experts, citing in part the experience with SARS, another coronavirus, argued in a paper earlier this month that as droplets from an infected person start to evaporate, the resulting smaller particles can indeed become airborne.
They point to evidence that passengers confined to their cabins on cruise ships like the Diamond Princess were infected through the vessels’ air ducts.
“It is highly likely that the SARS-CoV-2 virus also spreads by air,” they conclude, urging “all possible” action in response, including modifications to ventilation systems. “We predict that … failure to immediately recognize and acknowledge the importance of airborne transmission and to take adequate actions against it will result in additional cases.”
Then there was the Guangzhou restaurant case, detailed in a U.S. Centers for Disease Control online journal recently. Researchers concluded flow from an air conditioner moved over three tables, carrying virus from the infected patron at the middle one to the far table, then back to the diners closest to the air conditioner.
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) engineers have long known that tiny particles of pathogen can be carried in the air that is circulated, heated and cooled in modern buildings, said Fleck. He pointed to Legionnaires disease, a bacterial pneumonia first traced to a hotel’s air-conditioning system.
The particle can stay airborne long enough to go all the way through the system and then pop out in somebody else’s office
“This has been on people’s radar for quite a while,” he said. “Somebody on a different floor sneezes …The particle can stay airborne long enough to go all the way through the system and then pop out in somebody else’s office.”
There are various ways that risk can be lessened, including use of filters that catch a greater number of those particles, and drawing more fresh air into a system. It also is likely that higher levels of humidity – a factor that only some Canadian buildings can adjust – will help kill off the virus, said Fleck.
But each of those changes carries a cost. Adding more fresh air can require additional heat or air conditioning. Heavier filters means more energy is needed to push the air through them. And more humidity can lead to mould, he noted.
“This will make for difficult decision making.”
Funded by the Canadian Institute for Health Research, the University of Alberta project is led by engineering professor Lexuan Zhong and also involves pediatrics professor Lisa Hartling. It consists of three phases: systematically reviewing literature on air circulation and viruses, determining what strategies would be effective and then carrying out a detailed audit of all the buildings on the Edmonton campus to create a real-world model of what should be done.
The team hopes to have solid results by the summer of 2021, said Fleck.

574,"Covid-19: online games are helping social-distancing Hongkongers kill time, but few willing to pay for it, firms say","Hongkongers are playing video games more than ever due to being stuck at home under the city’s Covid-19 social-distancing rules , but they are also spending less money on them given their pessimism about the economy, according to local gaming companies.
Despite the growth in terms of players, revenue at some local companies has dropped 5% to 15% since the pandemic’s outbreak . That stands in contrast to the global market, which has seen growth in both, two members of the Hong Kong Game Industry Association (HKGIA) said recently.
“During the time of Sars [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in 2003, the number of players and revenues increased by 30% to 40%. But what is special about this outbreak is that it has made many people pessimistic about the future of the economy,” said Jack Lai, chairman of the HKGIA and manager of Chinesegamer International (Hong Kong).
“In this outbreak , many people are afraid of losing their jobs, so it is safer to keep their money in their pockets and try not to spend it on luxuries. I think the business model for our games is very similar to the models for watches or jewellery, which requires spare money.
“Showing off a piece of virtual equipment in a game and showing off a luxurious watch in the real world are the same, and the willingness to show off and spend money is not as strong when players have no confidence in the economy.”
Many online games allow players to enhance their experience by paying real-world dollars to access additional content, boost in-game abilities or make cosmetic improvements to online characters.
Based on exchanges with peers at other companies, Lai estimated overall downloads were up 10% to 20%, while overall revenues were down 5% to 15%, compared with data before the pandemic.
HKGIA has 34 member companies, whose revenues account for 60% to 70% of the market share, according to Lai.
The revenues at his company have fallen 20% to 30% due to the pandemic, Lai added.
The scene in Hong Kong stands in sharp contrast with the global scene, where gaming revenues and downloads are growing. Mobile game downloads rose 20% globally in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year, and consumers spent more than US$6.7bil (RM29.20bil) on mobile gaming in the quarter, 5% higher than the three months prior, data from the app analytics firm App Annie shows.
There are two main factors contributing to the drop in revenue in Hong Kong, according to Lai – the overall economic downturn and the postponement of new game releases.
Since many mobile and online games are free to play, many players have no incentive to spend on in-game upgrades, said Sze Lingling, chief operations officer of Gameone Group, one of the largest gaming companies in Hong Kong and an HKGIA member.
“Nowadays people just use games to kill time ... they can get a game and play for a long time,” she said.
The postponement of new releases amid the pandemic has also impacted gaming company revenues.
Chinesegamer International’s new mobile game Heroes Of Huang Yi , based on martial arts-themed stories by Hong Kong novelist Wong Cho-keung, was expected to be released in February or March, but was postponed until June.
Large-scale promotional activities and exhibitions, which account for about half of the company’s publicity plans, are impossible during the pandemic, he said.
Gameone’s new game The Ravages Of Time , adapted from a comic series by Hong Kong artist Chen Mau, has also been postponed until August.
According to the PayPal 2018 Global Gaming report, 90% of Hongkongers play video games at least once a week. – South China Morning Post

639,Parañaque City shuts illegal Chinese clinics selling COVID-19 ‘medicine’,"Authorities raided and shut two Chinese-owned illegal clinics in Parañaque City last night for allegedly selling medicines that purportedly treated the coronavirus.
First to be raided by the police was a Baclaran Village clinic that was located above a milk tea shop. Bearing the sign “Chinese Hospital,” the facility was decked with IV drip stands and sold medicines for three weeks that were neither approved nor checked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), reports ABS-CBN News.
Based on English translations of the Chinese labels, most of the drugs were injectables meant to treat HIV , other sexually transmitted diseases, and dengue, Remate reports. Herbal supplements that treated colds, fever, cough, and sore throat, along with non-prescription drugs for flu and other respiratory illnesses were also sold.
“They have all kinds of medicines. I was amazed because most of the medicines I saw were injectables. There were a few oral meds, but there were a lot of IV [intravenous] fluids,” Dr. Olga Virtucio of the Parañaque City Health Office told CNN Philippines.
“There are beds, but not enough to be called a hospital. It’s more of a clinic,” she added.

Authorities said they raided the facility after an unidentified informant told them that several Chinese patients visited the clinic to seek a cure for COVID-19.
After the local government shut the clinic, authorities had found a second clinic operated by a Chinese man who claimed to be a licensed medical doctor back in his home country. The clinic was similarly treating patients for the coronavirus, according to the police.

The police are still investigating both clinics and Mayor Edwin Olivarez has asked the Bureau of Immigration to deport the Chinese nationals.
The owners will be charged for violating quarantine laws, medical regulations, and for operating without permits. The seized medicines will be turned over to the FDA for testing.
There is no known cure or vaccine for COVID-19. Experts have estimated that it will take about 18 months to create a reliable vaccine.

795,CHINESE STATE MEDIA USES TIK-TOK VIDEO OF TREVOR NOAH FOR CORONAVIRUS PROPAGANDA,"A Chinese state media outlet is using Tik-Tok videos of the Daily Show’s Trevor Noah to amplify Communist Party propaganda about the coronavirus pandemic.

“Chinese state propaganda is now making TikToks of Trevor Noah,” tweeted Jack Posobiec. “We are entering a whole new era of information warfare.”

The video was posted to Tik-Tok, a Chinese-owned app, by CGTN (China Global Television Network), a state-owned media group run by the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China.

The clip features Noah explaining how, “The Chinese government has announced there has been so much improvement in Wuhan that the lockdown will be lifted there.” Noah then jokes about the people of Wuhan “discriminating against us” by closing down their borders to “prevent the America virus from coming in.”

The quip is based on the media’s anger at President Trump for calling COVID-19 the “Chinese virus” (despite the fact that innumerable other viruses throughout history have been named after their place of origin).

Even liberal talk show host Bill Maher slammed the media’s indignation at Trump’s description on his show last week.

It seems that the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China and CGTN thought that Noah was a perfect mouthpiece through which to amplify their propaganda, which has been focused on denying culpability for coronavirus despite hefty evidence that Beijing covered up COVID-19’s severity and spread in its early days.

Meanwhile, Tik-Tok banned numerous ‘America First’ accounts today after leftist media hit pieces demanded their removal.

52,Malta looks to start easing COVID-19 measures - Xinhua,"Malta is planning to start gradually easing COVID-19 pandemic counter-measures in the coming days after the country registered no new cases, Health Minister Chris Fearne announced on Sunday.
Out of 448 cases detected in Malta since the confirmation of the first case in early March, 282 have recovered, according to the minister.
Addressing a press conference, Fearne said the sacrifices that people had been asked to make in the past few weeks had paid off.
Malta, he said, took a cautious approach from the outset and had rolled out its plan to be hit by a ""river rather than a tsunami"" so that the country's healthcare system could be able to cope with the demand.
""We always said that we should aim to avoid a tsunami of cases and instead turn the spread into a river, and we have managed to achieve that, also because the majority of the Maltese people obeyed the guidelines of the health authorities and adhered to the instructions to stay home and stay safe,"" Fearne said.
He warned that despite the good news, the pandemic was not over yet.
Fearne urged people to continue observing the guidelines that will remain in place for the time being until the health authorities, based on scientific evidence, start to relax some of the measures introduced gradually over the weeks.
He said the measures will see the re-introduction of some of the health services that were stopped to allow the authorities to concentrate on the virus spread. The government will then also see that social life will be gradually restored and economic activity re-activated.
""There could be a second wave so the authorities wanted to make sure that even this hit us slowly so that we can cope with the demand,"" he said.
Replying to questions, Fearne said 28,000 tests had been carried out and the government did not plan to introduce mandatory testing across the population. It was also against using any app that could track people and invade on their privacy.
Speaking in a radio interview concurrently, Prime Minister Robert Abela said the government was looking at achieving the right balance between restoring life to what it was before the pandemic hit and retaining the success it has had so far in its fight.
The key to managing this process was striking a balance between easing off the measures too soon and not waiting too long.
Malta is currently in partial lockdown, with people over 65 and those suffering from certain health conditions not allowed to leave their homes. It banned travel and is only accepting repatriation flights, with anyone arriving having to spend 14 days in mandatory quarantine.
It also introduced several other measures to prevent community spread over the past few weeks, including a ban on being in groups of more than three people unless from the same household, the closure of all schools and the suspension of all religious services and major events.
Court cases were put off and non-essential surgeries postponed. Banks closed some of their branches as a precaution and the government later ordered the closure of non-essential outlets excluding supermarkets, those selling household items and pharmacies.
Malta is also in the process of ordering a prefabricated 90-bed hospital, similar to the one built in Wuhan, China for COVID-19 patients. It will be set up in the grounds of the only state hospital on the island which has already been extended to full capacity in case it is needed. ",FAKE

Doctors at a hospital in California say they have recorded more deaths from suicide than coronavirus, with a year’s worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a 4 week period.

“Doctors at John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek say they have seen more deaths by suicide during this quarantine period than deaths from the COVID-19 virus,” reports ABC 7.

Dr. Mike deBoisblanc, the head of trauma at the hospital, said that he’d never seen suicide at this rate and that the numbers were “unprecedented.” He now says its time to fully end the lockdown.

“I think, originally, this (the shelter-in-place order) was put in place to flatten the curve and to make sure hospitals have the resources to take care of COVID patients.We have the current resources to do that and our other community health is suffering,” said Dr. deBoisblanc.

A veteran nurse who has been at the hospital for 33 years also sounded the alarm bell.

“What I have seen recently, I have never seen before,” said Kacey Hansen. “I have never seen so much intentional injury.”

All the district administrations in the region have been taking various measures to contain the coronavirus spread. Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam district collectors announced a total lockdown on Sunday in their districts.
To maintain social distance in a more effective manner, collectors of the three districts announced full shut down which was effective between 6am and 9pm on Sunday. Tiruvarur collector T Anand announced a 24-hour total lockdown till 6am on Monday.
A complete lockdown was observed by the people as the order was received well among residents of three districts with main roads and residential areas sporting a deserted look on Sunday. Roaming of people on two-wheelers on city roads was not witnessed during the shutdown.
In Trichy, no new cases were reported for the last 4 days while the number of cases in Karur district has been at 42 since April 17. In Nagapattinam district, the number of cases has been the same since April 20. However, the district administrations are awaiting results of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, sources from the health department said.

Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan’s memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch’s memory after she died from the new coronavirus COVID-19.  Jamon Jordan could not mourn his mother in the traditional way. At Jacquelynne Jordan's memorial in early April, there were just seven people. No hugs. No traditional dinner where family members could gather to honor the 66-year-old matriarch's memory.
That stripped-down scenario has played out hundreds of times in Detroit — 912 to be exact, the number of city residents who have died of COVID-19.
So amid the pandemic, Detroit — the nation's largest black city, the birthplace of distinctive soulful music and black cultural significance — grieves collectively.
Famed across the world as Motown, Detroiters know it as a big city with a small-town feel, with a connectivity that has only magnified the community's pain.
""People always say that Detroit is like a northern country town,"" said Marsha Battle Philpot, a cultural writer known as Marsha Music. ""There tends to be very closely knit familial connections. In Detroit, there's not six degrees of separation — there are only two and, most of the time, just one. Detroit has this character, which in a time like this, exacerbates the grief and the loss. But it will also be part of the recovery because Detroit is a fighting town.""
The virus has disproportionately impacted black Americans across the country, including Detroit, where more than 8,500 infections have been reported, with black people accounting for more than 64% of them. And nearly 77% of the city's residents who have died from coronavirus-related complications have been African American. The losses have shattered the city, compounded by a heightened economic uncertainty.
Among those lost: community pillars, dedicated public servants and Michigan's youngest victim, 5-year-old Skylar Herbert, whose parents, LaVondria and Ebbie Herbert, have served Detroit for decades — as a police officer and a firefighter.
""They've been on the front line and they've served with honor and integrity,"" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said after Skylar's death. ""They did not deserve to lose their child to this virus. Nobody does.""'
Jamon Jordan, who runs the Black Scroll Network History and Tours company in Detroit, contracted COVID-19 himself, most likely while giving tours in early March.
While he was battling the virus, his mother also fell ill. Despite his mother having existing health conditions, he said they both struggled to convince doctors they needed to be tested and were told not to come to the hospital and instead self-quarantine for two weeks.
Jordan got better; his mother grew sicker. She died March 28.
""She did not make it to two weeks,"" Jordan said. ""She was brought in by ambulance and, within an hour of arriving to the hospital, she had already passed away. I made it, but she didn't.""
And then her family could safely offer only an abbreviated farewell.
""In the African American community, homegoing celebrations, funerals, are just a part of a very spiritual experience that allows family and the community to move this ancestor onto the afterlife,"" said Jordan, a black historian. ""It's a part of a communal practice that goes all the way back to our African roots.
""It's a blow to this culture, our practices, our traditions, that we can't really say goodbye,"" he said. ""When this is over, there are things that will not exist in our community, there are ideas that we will never see come to fruition. Detroit will be different.""
Tributes cascade in every day on a Facebook COVID-19 group memorial page created by Michigan State Rep. Sherry Gay-Dagnogo. Just weeks after she started it, Gay-Dagnogo's own sister became one of hundreds honored on the page.
Julena Gay was Gay-Dagnogo's backbone, everything a sister should be. She died April 14 at the age of 63.
""This type of collective loss, it's profound,"" Gay-Dagnogo said. ""There's a fear of 'am I next?' I started this page because people need to get beyond the thought that black people aren't dying — they're dying in record numbers.""
Beyond the grief lies deep economic pain.
Despite gains in recent years, including the city emerging from bankruptcy, swaths of neighborhoods remain blighted and 33% of Detroit residents live below the poverty line. And city leaders announced this month that the pandemic has created a projected $348 million budget deficit.
A poll shared exclusively with The Associated Press, conducted in early April by the University of Michigan's Detroit Metro Area Communities Study, found 35% of Detroiters employed full time or part time before March 1 have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. The study surveyed 1,020 residents across demographics.
Jeffrey Morenoff, one of the study's faculty research leads and director of the university's Population Studies Center, said roughly 1 in 5 Detroiters say they will run out of money in three months. And research associate Lydia Wileden said the survey also found 49% of black residents are concerned about access to food, water and other supplies and 42% said they wouldn't be able to afford a $400 emergency expense.
For now, the focus is on how to help the city survive the widening ripples of devastating loss.
""There's going to be an aftermath of this, not only physically, socially, spiritually but also, mentally,"" said Bishop Edgar Vann, who has been senior pastor of Detroit's Second Ebenezer Church for 45 years.
""It's going to be difficult whenever you reopen because the norms that we had will be old and shattered. But there is a uniqueness about the city and, of course, one of them is the population being 80% African American. There is a certain spirit here, there's a grit, toughness and resilience.""

AGRA: A large number of people, who have been quarantined for suspected Covid-19 infections at various centres in Agra are experiencing a harrowing time due to poor facilities, including inadequate food and hygiene. Majority of them have not been tested for Covid-19, for which they have been shut behind closed doors.
A video, which has gone viral, shows food and water bottles being kept outside the quarantine centre and inmates collecting them from inside the locked gate. Some of them claimed that they are not getting adequate quantity of food packets and are sleeping empty stomachs.
According to Agra administration, there are around 21 active quarantine centres across Agra, housing about 800 inmates at present. ""About 30 more quarantine centres have been proposed by the administration for use, if needed,"" said ADM Pushpraj Singh, adding that they are presently using 50 percent of the capacity in order to effectively maintain social distancing among patients and to provide them all facilities.
However, one of the girls, who purportedly shot the video from a quarantine centre at Sharda Group of Institution in Sikandara, said that no social distancing is being maintained and all persons including her were brought there for a medical check up. She said that no tests have been conducted so far. She added that they are not even getting proper food and water.
The video and pictures circulating on the social media show a total lack of hygienic conditions inside. Empty food packets, leaking water taps and stained and dirty washbasins could be seen at the centre where these suspect patients are kept.
Singh, however denied these claims, saying that due to psychological trauma and panic, people may be ""reacting"" like this. He said, ""medical tests are being conducted on first come, first basis and adequate facilities are being provided there. He claimed that the inmates are also being provided rations for one week to 15 days at the time of their discharge from the centre"".
""The administration has also tied up with hotels for paid quarantine centres and if someone wants to shift there, they can do so by paying a Rs 800-1000 per day,"" he added.
Another girl, who was quarantined along with her 9 family members on Saturday, told TOI over phone that she doesn’t know whether her mother, who died, was Covid-19 positive or not. She said that her mother had expired after a few hours of her admission at SN Medical College.
""We all are at the quarantine centre and don’t know the reasons for it,"" said the girl, adding that they are not being informed about anything and the facilities there were very poor. She added that none of her family members were tested at the centre and were later shifted to their homes and quarantined there.
When contacted, SNMC principal, GK Aneja, said, ""the deceased was Covid-19 +ve and as per protocol her body would be cremated at the electronic moratorium”. He told TOI that she died with 35 minutes of the admission at the hospital as her condition was critical.

The Centre has however urged states not to lower the guards and cautioned those with high case loads to pay attention on lockdown measures and rigorous containment strategies.The toll due to the contagious infection has now increased to 826 as 47 more deaths were reported since Saturday and 5,913 who were infected with COVID-19, have been discharged or cured of the virus, taking the recovery rate to over 21 per cent.
“People should follow lockdown 2.0 in letter and spirit but it’s a relief to note that the situation is improving as some hot spot districts have now move to non hot-spot category,” said Union health ministry after reviewing the preparedness at AIIMS trauma centre in Delhi--a dedicated COVID-19 hospital.
Earlier, the total number of hotspot districts in India were 170 and but on Friday the Centre had said that there are 12 districts that have not recorded any new coronavirus cases in last 28 days. These districts earlier had reported confirmed cases of the disease.
On Sunday, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with the chief secretaries and police heads of all states to review the COVID-19 preparedness response. “He highlighted that states which are having high cases loads should focus on effective implementation of lockdown measures and containment strategy,” said a statement by the government.

333,Can Estrogen and Other Sex Hormones Help Men Survive Covid-19? - frnews,"As the novel coronavirus swept through communities around the world, preying disproportionately on the poor and the vulnerable, one disadvantaged group has demonstrated a remarkable resistance. Women, whether from China, Italy or the U.S., have been less likely to become acutely ill — and far more likely to survive. Which has made doctors wonder: Could hormones produced in greater quantities by women be at work? Now scientists on two coasts, acting quickly on their hunches in an effort to save men’s lives, are testing the hypothesis. The two clinical trials will each dose men with the sex hormones for limited durations. Last week, doctors on Long Island in New York started treating Covid-19 patients with estrogen in an effort to increase their immune systems, and next week, physicians in Los Angeles will start treating male patients with another hormone that is predominantly found in women, progesterone, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can potentially prevent harmful overreactions of the immune system. “There’s a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,” said Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who is the principal investigator for the progesterone study. She said 75 percent of the hospital’s intensive care patients and those on ventilators are men. And pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease. “So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,” Dr. Ghandehari said. Some experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with Covid-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause. The genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial’s principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Anthony Gasparis, with the idea. The trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said. “It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,” said Dr. Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York. The gender gap in coronavirus survival became apparent early in the pandemic. Reports from China indicated men were dying at higher rates, but the disparity was attributed to higher smoking rates. But the outcomes were consistent in other countries, with men in Italy dying at higher rates than women, and men in New York City dying at nearly double the rate of women. Scientists who study sex differences say that both biological differences in immunity, as well as behavioral factors are at play. Men smoke more almost everywhere, they say; men also wash their hands less. While women appear to have more robust immune systems, these experts say, the causes are complex and multifactorial, and hormones are only part of the picture. If such sex hormones were the primary protective factor for women, then elderly women with Covid-19 would fare as poorly as elderly men, because women’s reproductive hormones plummet after menopause, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But that’s not the case, she said. “We see this bias across the life course,” Dr. Klein said. “Older men are still disproportionately affected, and that suggests to me it’s got to be something genetic, or something else, that’s not just hormonal.” “Estrogen has immune modulatory properties — don’t get me wrong,” she continued. “You could get a beneficial effect in both men and women. But if women are better at recovery at 93 years old, I doubt it’s hormones.” Research has shown estrogen may have an effect on a protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for example. The coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells as an entry route, and ACE2 is regulated differently in men and women, said Kathryn Sandberg, director of the Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease at Georgetown University. In studies with rats, Dr. Sandberg and her colleagues have shown that estrogen can reduce ACE2 protein expression in their kidneys, so it is possible the hormone may reduce ACE2 expression in men as well. Dr. Nachman said, “We may not understand exactly how estrogen works, but maybe we can see how the patient does,” adding that estrogen played a complex role, both in the early immune response that could help clear a viral infection, as well as in a secondary clean up or repair response, which could evolve into a cytokine storm. “While we see women do get infected, their responses are different,” Dr. Nachman said. “We see fewer of them having the second, disregulated immune response.” The Stony Brook estrogen trial is recruiting 110 patients who come to the hospital’s emergency room with symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia, and who have either tested positive for Covid-19 or are presumed to have the illness, as long as they do not require intubation. The trial is open to adult men as well as to women aged 55 and older, since they have low levels of estrogen. Half of the participants will be given an estradiol patch for one week, while the other half will serve as a control group, and researchers will follow them to see whether estrogen reduces the severity of their disease. The Cedars-Sinai study is smaller, with only 40 subjects, all men, half of whom will be a control group. Only hospital inpatients with mild to moderate disease who have tested positive for Covid-19 can participate. (Patients with certain conditions, like a history of blood clots, are excluded for safety reasons.) The patients will get two shots of progesterone a day for five days. They will be monitored to see if their status is improving, how their needs for oxygen change and whether they go on to require intensive care or mechanical ventilation; their progress will be compared to patients in the control group. The researchers in Los Angeles are pinning their hopes on progesterone rather than estrogen because research has shown that the hormone reduces pro-inflammatory immune cells, and supports those that fight inflammation, Dr. Ghandehari said. The hypothesis is that progesterone will prevent or dampen a harmful overreaction of the immune system, called a cytokine storm, and will reduce the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both hormones are believed to be safe, especially when used for short durations. Participants will be warned of possible side effects that may be a first for many men, like tenderness in the breast and hot flashes. ",FAKE
48,Singapore reports 886 COVID-19 cases from foreign workers' dormitories ,"Singapore reports 886 COVID-19 cases from foreign workers' dormitories.
Coronavirus cases in Singapore crossed the 13,000-mark on Sunday after 931 positive cases, including 886 foreign workers living in packed dormitories, were confirmed. Another 25 were work permit holders living outside the dormitories, said the Health Ministry on Sunday. There were also two imported cases reported today. Both are Singaporeans who have been placed on stay-home notice upon their arrival in Singapore on Apr 10, said the ministry. Only 13 cases were from the local community, Singapore citizens and permanent residents (foreigners), with another five on work passes (foreigners), said the Ministry. The Sunday's cases raised the total number to 13,624. Twenty-two of the 1,311 cases still in hospital are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. Most are stable or their condition is improving, the ministry said. Fifty-eight people were discharged following recovery. In all, 1,060 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. Meanwhile, 11,241 cases are currently isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are cases that have mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19, Channel News Asia reported citing the ministry data. Singapore is now in an extended ""circuit breaker"" period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The period was extended to June 1, 2020 from the first set to end on May 4. It will take at least a week of sustained decline in local community cases, which excludes migrant workers, before Singapore can say that it has turned the corner, reported The Straits Times citing experts. The latest numbers on Sunday reined in any optimism that Singapore may be beginning to see some early signs of the infection curve flattening. On Saturday, nine community cases were confirmed, marking the first time numbers have dropped to the single digits this month. Numbers at dormitories also dropped to 597, down from about an average of a thousand daily in the five days before. Experts told The Straits Times that the slide in community cases needs to be sustained until at least the first week of May, and even then, the clusters at dormitories may remain a challenge. Foreign workers' dormitories have been locked down as the government struggles to curb the second wave of the COVID-19. Earlier, reported Channel News Asia cited experts as saying that five weeks from now if the number of daily COVID-19 cases in the community falls to single digits and the situation in the foreign worker dormitories improves, “circuit breaker” measures in Singapore may ease gradually.

178,FBI RAIDS DETROIT-AREA MEDICAL FACILITY ‘FOR USING INTRAVENOUS VITAMIN C TO TREAT COVID-19 PATIENTS’,"The FBI on Thursday raided a Detroit-area medical facility for reportedly treating non-hospitalized coronavirus patients with intravenous vitamin C, which the FBI appears to be claiming is a “fraudulent treatment.”

Allure Medical Spa, which is owned by Dr. Charles Mok, had been giving out vitamin C injections for free to first responders before the FBI came in and aggressively shut him down. FBI agents went into the building wearing full protective gear to protect themselves from potential exposure. Sources claim the raid is because Allure has been allegedly performing treatments for COVID-19 patients without an approved treatment or cure.

On April 18, Allure’s Facebook page had a post that said “At Allure Medical, we have been using intravenous vitamin c therapy to treat COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with great results.”

That post, as well as a post on Allure Medical’s official website on vitamin c treatments, has been taken down. After talking to staff members off-camera, some believe this is a misunderstanding. They claim the vitamin c is meant to help prevent or shorten the duration.

Dr. Charles Mok, who owns Allure Medical Spa, did a Facebook live video giving an IV-vitamin c treatment for free to a Detroit police officer. In the video, Mok said “What I’m finding in practice — I treat a lot of COVID patients — is that if we catch people early, get them on intravenous vitamin c, they turn around really fast.”

While it may not be a “cure,” vitamin C is being used widely as a treatment for coronavirus in hospitals throughout the world and has been shown to be effective in patients with sepsis and severe acute respiratory failure in past studies. Multiple clinical trials to study its effectiveness at treating the coronavirus are currently ongoing.

FOX 2 Detroit, which simply parroted the line fed to them by the FBI, claimed vitamin C is a “fake treatment” and quoted FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider saying the clinic was accused of providing “fraudulent treatments for COVID-19” and allegedly “did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.” FOX 2 Detroit said a doctor at the facility told them Dr. Mok is “ahead of the curve in this type of treatment and has always put the [patients’] health first, often treating them for free.”

“Vitamin C infusion, is a common practice in the US because it boosts the immune system,” the doctor said.

“I’ve gone there for several years and always found them to be so welcoming and helpful and informative,” one of their patients told FOX 2 Detroit.

“The FBI said that no one is in custody, no arrests were made but they did say that this was an ongoing investigation,” FOX 2 Detroit reported.

Here’s what appears to be a press release Allure Medical put out the day of the raid:

Allure Medical Offering High-Dose Intravenous Vitamin C to Frontline Employees

Allure Medical is providing high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy to all frontline employees who are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and to existing COVID-19 patients. “We are using high-dose IV vitamin C to help support peoples’ immune systems and to help those with the virus recover quicker. We want to provide this treatment to those who need it, regardless of their ability to pay,” says Dr. Charles Mok, founder of Allure Medical.

Intravenous vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to help the disease associated with COVID-19 – Severe Acute Respiratory (SARS – COV 2). In numerous studies intravenous vitamin C appears to reduce the duration and severity in more moderate forms of COVID-19 by stimulating your immune system. High-dose intravenous vitamin C is becoming the standard of care for patients.

If you are a frontline worker exposed to the COVID-19 or are currently showing any symptoms, you may want to boost your immune system with high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy. Most insurers have waived the co-pay deductibles for COVID-19-related diagnosis. Allure Medical is providing at risk, frontline workers, at no charge. Frontline workers, such as hospital staff, policemen, first responders, grocery store employees and others working closely with the public, are at a higher risk for contracting COVID-19. In addition, the general public can contact Allure Medical to conduct a telehealth evaluation to determine if immune support with a high-dose intravenous vitamin C therapy would be beneficial. Please note: Allure Medical will not treat sick people at the same time as healthy people and continues to exceed CDC guidelines for disinfectants and cleanliness.

The only statement I can imagine the FBI could have taken issue with is Mok saying they’re using it to “help those with the virus recover quicker.”

It hasn’t been proven yet in double-blind clinical trials that vitamin C helps coronavirus patients recover quicker but this is a doctor recommending a common treatment of a heavily studied, essential vitamin to non-hospitalized patients for (mostly) free.

Raiding his facility and shutting his business down for giving free vitamin C treatments in the midst of a pandemic strikes me as massive overkill.

484,CALIFORNIA SUSPENDS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO PROTESTS,"The California Highway Patrol (CHP) has imposed perhaps the most draconian measure yet as the United States grapples with the COVID-19 outbreak, disallowing groups from peacefully assembling on state grounds after a Monday protest in which Californians defied the state’s “stay-at-home” order.

“Permits are issued to provide safe environments for demonstrators to express their views,” CHP said, according to The Sacramento Bee.

“In this case, the permit for the convoy was issued with the understanding that the protest would be conducted in a manner consistent with the state’s public health guidance.”

“That is not what occurred, and CHP will take this experience into account when considering permits for this or any other group,” the law enforcement entity continued.

On Monday, hundreds of Californian’s swarmed the Capitol complex in Sacramento, causing traffic jams and honking their horns while people gathered to express their objections to being forced to stay in the house. Apparently, such peaceful assembly has been deemed “unsafe” by the California Highway Patrol, and the law enforcement entity has decided to suspend the First Amendment until further notice.

California’s Democrat Governor Gavin Newsom has not publicly commented on the issue.
Many states, notably Michigan, have imposed strict “stay-at-home” orders.

That state banned gatherings of 10 or more people, and barred residents from traveling to visit other residents.

But even Democrat Governor Gretchen Whitmer did not ban protests of her orders, though she did extend the lockdown after the latest round of angry citizens protested at the State Capitol.

With the nation’s economy collapsing, 22 million unemployed Americans, and experts predicting a recession, many citizens are bucking to reopen the country and get back to work.

Not everyone thinks the country should reopen just yet, though.

363,Unnecessary Panic Over the “Corona” Virus,"I wanted to address the media’s fear mongering and panic with the new “corona virus,” and China’s overdoing it with the closing down of whole cities out of hysteria and panic. But I spent more time on my previous post than I had planned. So I will make this more brief.
Over the past several years I have come to see just how the mainstream news media have become mostly repeaters of official government press releases. It’s mainly propaganda, as we have seen and continue to see with the coverage of the 2016 election-Russia investigation and this impeachment farce. The media are the same with medical issues, in their being spokespeople for the pharmaceutical companies.
So, I really want to link to Jon Rappoport’s two recent posts that address these issues, on the latest virus, the “corona” virus. Those two posts are: China virus epidemic – the Gong Show on roller skates , and on the man who mushed the SARS dud now pushing new Chinese virus . Very good information and insight, in my opinion.
He makes reference to how in the past such as with SARS the media would not disclose that many cases of “SARS” were really patients with flu-like symptoms but who did not test positive for the “SARS” virus.
Rappoport brings up how medical and government officials don’t seem to want to look at an area’s sanitation and water systems, which are very important in these issues. There are also areas of malnutrition, in which a common problem is the compromised immune systems of many in the population, in which toxic vaccines and other pharmaceutical drugs are killing them.
But, “THE VIRUS” is what needs to be obsessed with. In these “epidemics,” many of those suffering don’t actually test positive for the virus in question. They have flu-like symptoms. And one reason some of the people with the sicknesses actually die — and I did hear a newscaster mention this, I couldn’t believe a little truth was told — is because those people already had other serious medical conditions.
So, people with medical conditions should be as well-nourished as possible, for prevention.
But in China, a country with an ultra-authoritarian government that already keeps the masses in fear of the regime with the “social credit score,” etc., the government is closing down whole cities? Those rulers are even worse control freaks than the power-addicted people in Washington.",FAKE

646,"The Corona Virus Challenge, Nigeria And Other Responses By Reuben Abati","The biggest threat to our collective humanity today is not the suspected threat of a Third World War, but a corrosive, debilitating, murderous pathogen known as new Corona Virus. The fear of a World War III was fuelled by tensions and differences among key super powers dictating contemporary geo-politics notably: the United States, China, Iran, Iraq, Israel, North Korea, South Korea and the entire Middle East. But while relationships with the world’s power axis will always have implications for global peace, security and stability, the biggest and the most urgent threat by far is the outbreak of a new strain of the Corona Virus, in Wuhan, China which has within a short space of one month shown the vulnerability of man, the conflict between man and biology, and the limitations of science in the face of an immediate, accidental, unforeseeable, pathogenic onslaught.
The first case of Corona Virus was reported just before the Chinese Lunar New Year 2020 celebrations, and since then, the new virus has defied both man and science. On January 28, the highest number of reported cases was reported, but by Monday, February 10, that had jumped exponentially to 97 casualties per day and total cases in excess of 40, 000, with 908 persons reported dead. The statistics and the sero-prevalence rate seem unprecedented, far worse than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome of 2003 which claimed 774 lives. The World Health Organization has classified the new Corona Virus as a public health emergency of international concern, a delicate, diplomatic phrasing which barely stops short of declaring the nCoV-2019, as it is otherwise known, a global pandemic – considering the fact that mainland China, especially Wuhan, a city of 11 million people and the Hubei province in general, remain the epicenter – 99% of reported cases are in mainland China and out of the total number of deaths, only two have occurred outside China. READ Stephen Keshi Stadium To Be Completed In Two Months, Says Okowa
The Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has commended China for its efforts at prevention and containment, even if the Politburo, the highest political body in China has had to express regrets for “failing” the people. The truth is: China is overwhelmed. Businesses have been affected, the stock market is down, lives are threatened, over 40 million people are in quarantine. China is engaging the world as the epicenter of a crisis, the global economy is likely to be affected given China’s strategic importance, and yet nobody knows when the Corona virus will ease off, or when scientists will find a cure. It is not only China that is at risk, it is the entire world. Our civilization is under threat and of course, the tragedy is man-made. These are the cold, uncomfortable facts as at the time of this writing. The Corona Virus has brought the entire world to the precipice of uncertainty and disaster. It reminds us collectively of our mortality and the common humanity and vulnerability that we share.
Globalization turned the world into a small village, technology erased distances, but in the face of a global scourge like new Corona Virus, the world has turned into a much smaller village. Most of the people and countries that are taking precautions against Corona Virus don’t even know where Wuhan is on the map. Some people ate snake meat or is it Pangolin or bat meat in Wuhan and they got infected with a virus – animal to man transmission, which has now spread to over 27 countries and mutated as a deadly human-to-human communicable disease. China which is ordinarily regarded as a major superpower has suddenly become a pariah nation. Countries have issued travel alerts to their citizens: do not go to China, and those who are in China are being evacuated and whoever arrives from China is immediately quarantined for two weeks.
This is the same China that only recently engaged the United States in a trade war. The same China is now the diseased nation that nobody wants to touch. Imports from China have been suspended. Trips to China have been put on hold. China’s tourism industry is bound to suffer. Who wants to go to a country where a virus is on rampage, and the air is polluted? It is not for nothing that the media in Europe has dubbed the Corona Virus, the China Virus – an average Chinese citizen would not like that – but the truth is that the new Corona Virus wears the toga of a nationality. Before it, there was the Swine flu (2009), Polio (2014), Zika (2016), Ebola (2014, 2019) but it is the new Corona Virus that has obtained a national passport and an identification tag of notorious universal recognition. This may have translated into racist conclusions about Chinese identity and cuisine. I have heard allegations that the Chinese eat anything and everything, including animals that are considered a taboo in many cultures – Bats? Cockroaches? Rats? Snakes? Millipedes and centipedes? Monkeys? Pangolin? E-eeish! It is said that the Chinese have brought this latest biological dissonance upon humanity because of their unusual culinary taste. I know people who have simply opted to stay away from anything Chinese in the meantime, until there is some certainty about what exactly is going on. I wanted to order food from a Chinese Restaurant the other day. I was quietly reminded of Corona Virus. I had no option but to restrain my palate. I wanted Chinese balm, a popular product in Nigeria, a few days later. I was also advised to be careful. I ignored that advice. The labelling of everything Chinese as an item crowned by a virus is exaggerated and overblown. But as Nigerians would say in pidgin English: who wan die?
This is probably why every country and institution is taking precautions. The United Kingdom, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand have had cause to evacuate their citizens from China. Airlines including FinnAir, American Airlines, United, Cathay Pacific, Air India, Ethiopian Airlines, British Airways, Air Asia, and Lufthansa have either stopped flights to China or reduced their Chinese operations by 90%. The effect is that supply chains have been disrupted with consequences for trade performance. The global economy is bound to slow down in the long run if this situation persists. But what is perhaps more relevant to us should be this: How prepared is Africa and particularly Nigeria? I don’t think Africa is prepared at all, and we are likely to be worst hit should the virus make an effective landing in our continent.
For now across Africa, we have only heard of suspected cases: in Ghana where there were two suspected cases involving a Chinese and an Argentine who returned from China, but the result was negative in both cases. Suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Botswana have also proven negative. The only reported case of infection involving an African is that of a Cameroonian student living in Wuhan. Kenya has taken steps to evacuate its students in China. Mozambique has suspended its visa on arrival policy. Africa and South America seem insulated from the scourge so far. But for how much longer? The Chinese Lunar New Year Holiday was extended, in the face of the outbreak of the virus, but that holiday ended yesterday, Monday, February 10. Using that as guide, if there was any Chinese living in Africa or doing business in Africa, he or she is likely to return to base after the holiday. In the last decade or more, Sino-African relationship has grown tremendously, China seeking to fill a vacuum inadvertently created by the EU and the United States, has increased its scope of influence in Africa through friendly loans, investments and cultural outreach. It is not an accident that African leaders at the just concluded 33rd AU Heads of State Summit in Addis Ababa expressed solidarity with China! The Chinese presence in Africa is unmistakable and it is quite pronounced in a country like Nigeria where the Chinese are involved in significant sectors of the economy including oil and gas, telecommunications, manufacturing, infrastructure, SMEs and retail trade. This week, all the Chinese who went home on holiday will start returning one after the other.
When the story of the Corona Virus broke, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) was most unusually proactive, which I think is commendable. The Federal Ministry of Health quickly followed suit, to educate Nigerians about the threat of the Corona Virus. Preventive guidelines were announced, and a travel advisory was issued. This is indeed commendable, even if the efforts were not translated into local, indigenous languages, that is – the languages of the majority of Nigerians. The campaign has thus far been so elitist and restricted. In due course, the Nigerian authorities further announced that the Federal Government had established eight isolation centres as follows: in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and seven states of the Federation – Lagos, Akwa Ibom, Rivers, Enugu, Delta, Cross River and Kano. The problem is that nobody knows exactly where these isolation centres are located.
The relevant authorities tell us that in preparing for the Corona Virus which has not yet been reported in Nigeria, they are relying on the protocols and infrastructure already put in place in 2014 to combat the Ebola Virus. In 2014, Nigeria was confronted with the Ebola Virus crisis, introduced to the country by a traveler from Liberia who came to Nigeria to seek spiritual cure for Ebola. Knowledge and experience can definitely prove useful in everything including a biological and pharmaceutical crisis such as Corona Virus. But has Nigeria done enough or is Nigeria prepared? I don’t think so. There is definitely no evidence that we have enough medical counter-measures to protect the medical and public health personnel who are supposed to man our ports. A gentleman who just returned from Chicago reported on live television and I have no cause to doubt him, that the situation at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport in Lagos, to cite a specific example, is chaotic and below standard practice. Government officials pretend to check for high temperature and other symptoms but they are not protected. Nigeria has not made any provision for medical counter measures. Nigeria is sending medical personnel and Ministry officials to the ports to put them at risk. Until we have another case of Stella Adadevoh, like Li Weliang, the Chinese whistleblower who paid the supreme price for Corona Virus, the Nigerian government is not likely to wake up. That is unacceptable.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health and state governments have to do a lot more. I will comment on the latter. As at this moment, only three states – Lagos, Ebonyi and Ogun out of the 36 states of the Federation would seem to have shown interest in the Corona Virus prevention campaign. We expect every state of the Federation, close as they are to the grassroots, to take up the campaign and inform the populace appropriately. At the national level, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and the Federal Ministry of Health will also need to address what has become around the subject of Corona Virus, an “infodemic crisis” – that is the crisis of conspiracy theories and misinformation and hazardous false information. Is the Corona Virus a biological weapon?. Really? Is it a strategy by big pharmaceutical companies to enlarge market and increase profit? President Donald Trump and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have also been linked to the conspiracy. Does that make sense? We have also been told that eating garlic or drinking a bleach concoction can help prevent a Corona Virus infection. Is that true? The Nigerian agencies are yet to respond to this. They should. They should take the additional step of addressing the spiritual question which determines everything in Nigeria from politics to business. Is Corona Virus a spiritual affliction or biology gone awry? If care is not taken, Nigerian shamanists, prophets, traditionalists and pastors will soon take advantage of the uncertainty to claim that they had predicted the occurrence of the virus and that, indeed they have the solution. Government should immediately arrest anyone who mouths such idiocy. Our only hope is that the Corona Virus will never make its way here, but as the Boys Scouts motto states, we should “Be Prepared”. The bad news is that there is no effective treatment for the virus. And a worse virus may soon show up, leaving humanity effectively at the mercy of disease and the environment.",FAKE

127,M-m-m-my corona scare,"For something different (note sarcasm) I am writing about the coronavirus, which currently is taking up about 50 per cent of our media reports each day.
So I guess my little contribution won’t make much difference.
The thing is I find it hard to understand what is fact and what is fake news.
It is pretty hard to decipher – a bit like climate change.
We do know it’s there but depending on what reports you read, hear and from what angle, it is hard to figure how bad it is.
Now before I go any further I am not making light of what is happening worldwide with this virus.
But I am going to make a little light of what happened to me last week.
Before I do that, I do want to share something serious with you.
I was in Denpasar Airport the other day on my way back from Bali and I was doing my usual people watching when I saw something I wished I hadn’t.
I was sitting at a bar waiting for my plane and there was a flight to Kuala Lumpur boarding opposite me.
Now at least half the people in the airport had masks on.
As I sat there about half a dozen Aussies in a group walked past, pulled their shirts over their heads and basically abused the Asians getting on the plane about the virus.
I couldn’t believe it. It was awful.
Which brings me to a slightly lighter note.
While I was sitting there, old mate texts me from home answering a comment I sent to her about half the airport having masks on, asking “Well, where’s yours?”
“Don’t make them for heads like mine,” I replied.
She says, “Not funny.”
That was the end of the banter.
I boarded my plane and had a really nice relaxing flight home where I contemplated that fact that for the past 18 months and a dozen trips to Bali, this was the first one that I never had one sick day.
Awesome, I thought, as I snoozed homeward bound.
Arrived back in the hood about midnight and woke the next morning feeling a bit odd.
Went to get up and had vertigo followed by projectile vomiting, which was distinctly green in colour and I started sweating bullets on a morning where it was about 20C.
My dear other half who had just kissed me had a look of “get the hell away from me, I told you to wear a mask”.
So I adjourned to the driveway with my plastic bucket. After it just continued to get worse I rang the ambulance stating, “Look this is probably a false alarm but I have just come back from Bali and have blah blah blah”.
The paramedics arrived shortly after following the proper procedures and took me off to Sunshine Coast University Hospital where I was poked, prodded and measured by the unlucky crew that picked me up.
The medical team ruled out coronavirus but over a period of a couple of hours I reckon I did a pretty good impression of a harp seal echoing the corridors of the hospital with some pretty wild sounds.
I spent the day there feeling much better after treatment and some wonderful care.
It just reminded me, on a few fronts, how wonderful our medical and emergency staff are.
We are so lucky and no matter what happens with the coronavirus we need to all remain compassionate human beings.
Thank you, Queensland Health.",FAKE

42,nCoV-2019 isn’t a novel virus: Other views,"“Seventeen years ago, I was covering the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus for several months as it spread across Asia, eventually reaching 37countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them. ... By far, the most important measures to stop the Wuhan coronavirus will be those related to hospitals and how well medical teams can contain the virus. ... Most of the SARS cases in Hong Kong went to two hospitals: One had just a single health care worker infected, while the other suffered terrible losses in both health workers and patients who were being treated for other medical ailments. The key difference? The teams in the better hospital had years of infection control training.” OUR VIEW: Coronavirus offers reasons for concern but not for panic David Quammen , The New York Times : “‘Novel coronavirus of 2019’ ... isn’t as novel as you might think. ... Zheng-Li Shi, of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, (is) a senior author of the draft paper that gave nCoV-2019 its identity and name. It was Shi and her collaborators who, back in 2005, showed that the SARS pathogen was a bat virus that had spilled over into people. Shi and colleagues have been tracing coronaviruses in bats since then, warning that some of them are uniquely suited to cause human pandemics. ... When you’re done worrying about this outbreak, worry about the next one. Or do something about the current circumstances, (which) include a perilous trade in wildlife for food, with supply chains stretching through Asia, Africa and to a lesser extent, the United States and elsewhere. That trade has now been outlawed in China, on a temporary basis, but it was outlawed also during SARS, then allowed to resume — with bats, civets, porcupines, turtles, bamboo rats, many kinds of birds and other animals piled together in markets such as the one in Wuhan, China.” Frank Sieren , Deutsche Welle , Germany: “The scale of Beijing’s measures so far is unprecedented. Only an authoritarian one-party state could have implemented them so rapidly: Some 56million people are under quarantine and air, rail and long-distance bus traffic has been suspended in at least 14 cities. What is incredible is that there have been no demonstrations, let alone riots, in the regions affected. ... The situation was different with the 2002-03 SARS outbreak: The scale of the epidemic was played down for months. By the time it had been brought under control, 800 people had died. Now, Beijing is providing information about the number of cases and casualties almost every hour. Even the construction of the new hospital is ... live-streamed.” Vin Gupta , NBC News : ""As a pulmonologist in Seattle, near where the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in the United States last week, I relied heavily on the city’s hospitals, clinics and departments of health to protect our community. And they did so admirably, immediately acting decisively and shrewdly despite the fear and uncertainty that always arises with an invisible biological threat. ... Just 0.19% of the U.S. budget goes toward pandemic preparedness overseas. Yet any money that we do spend means we mitigate the risk of facing outbreaks at home. ... It’s not just inadequate funding that keeps us behind. Two high-profile global health security experts departed the administration in 2018, diminishing the chances that leadership from within may change these dangerous realities. Which means that unless hospitals and providers are given the necessary financial resources, Americans may soon be more vulnerable to threats like Ebola and coronavirus that pay no attention to politics or budgetary cycles but which demand a health system ready and primed to respond.""

747,Corona Virus — darkness in China. The West waits while reports come that a mild illness may progress badly,"One day ago, the statistics were looking good but there have been a few ominous shifts. Another 26 infections have been recorded, some in a French ski chalet, some in Singapore – at least three of which are hard to explain . These appear to be transmissions outside China, which is what we are hoping to avoid. It’s bad, but could have been a lot worse. Fortunately the Diamond Princess tally hasn’t risen much — standing at 64. Another plus — it’s almost two weeks since one passenger on a Tiger Air flight in Australia flew as he was coming down with symptoms yet the other 157 passengers appear to be OK. Promising. … Just 2% of cases so far are severe outside China (but that may grow)
The all important statistics outside of China are starting to accrue — So far there are 355 infections. Of those, 35 have recovered and only eight are marked as severe (see the table below). It’s good news that only 2% are severe, however it’s too soon to know — 90% are still unwell.
The illness appears to be less severe outside China, but a new study reports that this virus often looks benign to start with. It begins with a mix of mild symptoms that can look like the common cold, or resemble gastro. But some patients go on to develop breathing trouble five days later, and may need the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) by day 8. Sometimes people get released from medical care, but then have to return the next week. So not only must we wait 14 days for the incubation period, there may be another 8 days (or more) before we know how many will need emergency life support and we can begin to calculate the fatality rate. Unfortunately that means there may be a sting in this tail coming. We can’t take too much comfort in all the early reports of mild effects. Though we hope that the outcome in the West will be different due to a better resourced medical system that is not overwhelmed with an unmanageable case load, and other local factors. New Report on 138 Coronavirus Cases Reveals Disturbing Details New York Times Reporting on Friday in JAMA , the authors said their data suggested that rapid person-to-person spread of the virus had occurred among their cases. That was in part because of patients like the one admitted to the surgical department, whose symptoms misled doctors into suspecting other illnesses and failing to take precautions to prevent spread of the virus until it was too late. About 10 percent of the patients did not initially have the usual symptoms, cough and fever, but instead had diarrhea and nausea first. Other uncommon symptoms included headache, dizziness and abdominal pain. Another cause for concern was that some patients who at first appeared mildly or moderately ill then took a turn for the worse several days or even a week into their illness. The median time from their first symptoms to when they became short of breath was five days; to hospitalization, seven days; and to severe breathing trouble, eight days. For this series of patients, the death rate was 4.3 percent.
China’s National Health Commission has given the virus a temporary official name – novel coronavirus pneumonia, or NCP . — South China Morning Post
In other news, it’s been confirmed CoronaVirus can spread via aerosol — like Influenza. That makes it easier to spread that just via contact, or respiratory droplet, though these are still described as the main routes. Protection from this means well fitted respiratory masks, 6 feet spacing between people, increasing ventilation and air flow, negative pressure rooms, and also goggles to protect eyes. It means cancelling large events in at risk populations for the moment. See the CDC recommendations. Something truly awful is going on in China. Dip into #coronavirus
People are being chased down the road by “medical teams”, dragged forcibly into quarantine . A woman in an apartment tower yells for help, “my husband is dying. There is no way out”. Officials carry guns , and there are frightening videos of them welding doors shut and locking people inside their homes. But I can’t find footage of deliveries of food and medicine to trapped citizens. This is not what people do in “a flu season”, they’re acting like it’s the plague.
There are reports, allegedly from within Wuhan hospitals that hundreds of patients a day are being classified as “pnumonic”, n ot as coronavirus. “ Daily removes pnumonic patients to not return, whole sections of hospital, 200 rooms each and not recorded. They are filled immediately with new pnumonic. Please know we are trying but there is simply too much…. would post more photo but other workers here and typing this under table…”
There are movies displayed below. If you can’t see them, try another browser. This behaviour of the ccp was expected! Locking people inside their homes!!
No surprises here It can also be spread by contact and by respiratory droplet. What does this mean? It’s hard to stop.

For a lighter moment, see one resident singing from a balcony doing his own concert for other people waving torches. He’s wearing the US flag. Is this China’s free speech revolution? See others wearing full-body inflatable cartoon characters as a way of protecting themselves against viruses. Comic but tragic.
Concert from a balcony ————- If I were ruler of the world I’d be closing borders and sitting tight for a few weeks
We’ll know so much more then. The cost of quarantine is enormous, but the cost of getting this wrong will be counted in “millions”— and that’s not dollars. If we wait to find out how serious this is, it could be too late to stop it. The recent UK / France outbreak has come via Singapore, so we know there is a risk from even well managed nations which are taking precautions. After a few weeks, borders can be opened again on a case by case basis with “clean nations”. This means people can confidently organize tours, conferences, holidays and weddings without fear of them being cancelled at short notice. A mandatory two week quarantine would be essential with nations that had outbreaks.
Wired Magazine pushes back against the trite comparisons with the flu. There are as many as 5 million severe cases of flu worldwide each year, and 650,000 deaths… Call it “viral whataboutism.” … this mutant form of rhetoric has come into discussions of what could be a massive epidemiological threat. Is the new coronavirus something to worry about? Yeah, sure, but so’s the flu… and you don’t seem to care too much about that! For goodness’ sake, stop. Yes, we know the flu is bad—no one likes the flu. But the gambit of positioning the influenza virus as the scarier of two foes is as dangerous as it is hackneyed. …these whatabout statistics aren’t really meant to sharpen our vigilance around the flu, or even to encourage us toward higher rates of vaccination. They’re just supposed to calm us down… Millions get the virus every year, and fewer than 0.1 percent of them perish from it. What’s the rate of death from the new coronavirus? No one can say for certain, but estimates have hovered at around 20 times the rate for influenza, or 2 percent . The statistics Sunday — thanks to Worldometer.

184,The 2019-nCoV Corona Virus,"There has been much talk and much misinformation being spread about the Corona Virus that is currently hitting China hard. As a statistician, I thought I would help to shed some light on the topic in terms that most of us can understand.
My data that I am using here is taken primarily from two sources:
Time - Map - John - Hopkins - University 1. The real time interactive map that John Hopkins University is using to present the current status and trend of the virus.
2. A Lancet Medical Journal article published a week ago and updated/corrected February 4th.
Image - Part - Map - China - Data The first image is part of a map of China. The data was updated as of 7:43 p.m. EST on Thursday. It is changing rapidly! The largest red circles that you see represent the provinces that have at least 1000 cases. When I started writing this post earlier this evening, there was only one large red circle, it contained 22,000 of the approximate 31,000 cases. By 8:30 when I saved this map there were two large circles. By 9:00 p.m. there were three. Within the next day or two there will be several more. This by the way is only confirmed cases. There is likely a multiplier effect of those who had such mild symptoms, that they did not even register as cases.

Virus - Market - Wuhan - Interaction The virus originated in a market in Wuhan through animal human interaction.
Wuhan is a major transportation hub, and the start of the virus corresponded with the Chinese Lunar New Year, when many were travelling.
Virus - Rate - Lancet - Journal - Article The virus is spreading at an exponential rate. The Lancet Journal article estimated a doubling of the number of cases every 6.4 days. From recent data, cumulative deaths are doubling about every four days.",FAKE
957,The 5-Second Trick For corona virus source,"Thus, it is very probable that potential SARS- or MERS-like coronavirus outbreaks will originate from bats, and there is an elevated probability that this will occur in China. As a result, the investigation of bat coronaviruses becomes an urgent problem with the detection of early warning indications, which consequently minimizes the effects of these kinds of upcoming outbreaks in China. The objective of the overview should be to summarize the current knowledge on viral diversity, reservoir hosts, along with the geographical distributions of bat coronaviruses in China, and at some point we purpose to forecast virus hotspots as well as their cross-species transmission potential.""Whilst nCoV is very about, clinic Emergency Departments and urgent care facilities need to take into account other far more popular diagnoses,"" she stated.“Immediately after getting assessed through the CDC, 23 of Those people passengers have been cleared and 4 men and women are increasingly being evaluated at a location hospital,” Murphy claimed in a press release.Four travellers on Friday were taken into a hospital just after their cruise ship arrived in Bayonne, New Jersey, for evaluation for just a coronavirusAt the very least two folks had been taken off the Anthem in the Seas cruise ship in stretchers this morning Four travellers aboard the ship had been transported to College Healthcare facility in Newark and at least two of them ended up taken out on stretchers, NBC News noted.This has resulted in one particular prediction the virus could infect about 39,000 of the thirty million folks living in the region of Wuhan. “It seems like the virus has bought from hand in China, distribute far too considerably, far too promptly to essentially be contained,” states Ian Mackay, a virologist within the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.Most coronaviruses infect animals, although not persons.

575,Trudeau announces $1.1-billion for COVID-19 research,"Plan includes an investment of close to $115-million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities The federal government will spend $1.1-billion to mobilize researchers to find a vaccine or other treatments for COVID-19, support clinical trials and expand national testing, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Mr. Trudeau said the plan includes an investment of close to $115-million for research into vaccines and treatments being developed in hospitals and universities and more than $662-million for clinical trials led by Canadian researchers.
The plan also includes a commitment of $350-million to expand national testing and modelling of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and the creation of an immunity task force to help determine the true extent of virus across Canada and the potential for reinfection before a vaccine is developed.
“A vaccine is the long-term solution to this virus, but these drugs will take months to develop a test, fabricate and roll out,” Mr. Trudeau said at his daily news briefing on Thursday.
Former University of Toronto president David Naylor and McGill University’s Catherine Hankins, a global health expert, will co-chair the panel, which will also include Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam, chief science adviser Mona Nemer and Tim Evans, director of McGill’s school of population and global health, Mr. Trudeau said.
“Canada’s best and brightest will be working on serology testing, blood testing to track and understand immunity to COVID-19. They’ll be looking at key questions like how many people beyond those we’ve already tested have had COVID-19, whether you’re immune once you’ve had it and, if so, how long that lasts,” Mr. Trudeau said.
Dr. Naylor said the task force will work to get a sense of background immunity against COVID-19 across the country, saying it’s important to get a big-picture view and look at vulnerable communities.
He said they will be doing longitudinal work to see how immunity of individuals changes over time and if people get reinfected. He said the task force will also work with scientists to get an in-depth understanding of biology of immunity to the virus.
“We still don’t know how big the iceberg is in this strange viral disease,” he said.
Mr. Trudeau said that over the course of two years, at least a million Canadians will be tested as part of the group’s study. The findings of the research will help with rolling out a potential vaccine and determining future public-health measures, he said.
Isaac Bogoch, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Toronto and the University Health Network in Toronto, was enthused by the announcement and said that funding for research is of tremendous need to improve diagnostics, therapeutics and prevention of COVID-19.
Dr. Bogoch said the task force will be able to gain a better understanding of the pandemic’s impact because they will be able to collect data that will help focus public-health policy.
“For example, to what extent are people who have recovered from COVID-19 immune? And if so, how long does that immunity last for? Those are extremely important questions to answer because you can … focus vaccine research around this. You can also target prevention methods in these populations as well,” he said.
Dr. Bogoch also explained that the type of testing Mr. Trudeau raised – serology testing – determines whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past. This testing is not yet being done in Canada. He said there are multiple companies and academic groups working on serological tests and they will be used in the country soon.
Mr. Trudeau said it may be a long time before there is a vaccine for COVID-19, but that there are discussions around treatments that might work.
“A vaccine, obviously, arriving soon would be the best solution,"" the Prime Minister said. ""But we need to make sure we are exploring all different ways of ensuring that Canadians’ quality of life and safety and protection is upheld in the best way we possibly can going forward.”
Unlike the more than $50-million in federal research grants for coronavirus studies made earlier this year, before Canada felt the full brunt of COVID-19, the science focus of Thursday’s much larger announcement was clearly aimed at dealing with a pandemic in full swing.
“We are in a different phase … the virus is here,” said Charu Kaushic, a professor at McMaster University in Hamilton and scientific director of the Institute for Infection and Immunity, part of Canada’s medical research apparatus.
Dr. Kaushic said there was enough capacity within the research community to absorb the new funds, in part because researchers in related fields are now coming forward with ideas and projects that may help battle the virus, reduce infections and improve outcomes for patients.
“Scientists are going all out to say, ‘I’m here. What can I do?’ ” Dr. Kaushic said. “Will it make a difference? I hope so.”

And for people like Puri Jagan, they can't avoid going to Bangkok for story-writing, relaxing and to work as well. So what is happening with these folks now?
Everyone who went to China in the last fortnight or who returned from places like Wuhan and other surrounding places are being screened for Corona Virus now. As the disease is in its deadliest form in China, where 340 members have already died and 11,000+ patients being treated in the ICUs, the whole world is on high alert now. Coming to Tollywood, as there is lot of travel between China and Bangkok, our celebs are fearing that the virus may come to the tourist nation as well.
For their own health safety, many celebs who are actually supposed to go to Bangkok are actually avoiding going there. After wapping the latest schedule of Fighter in Mumbai, even Puri Jagan is said to be planning to go to Goa for a couple of days rather Bangkok.

497,The Corona Virus—1918 All Over Again?,"Dr. Jane Orient: The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially. Biological threats proliferate—until they run out of susceptible victims. Published on January 31, 2020 Author World Health Organization
Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop “if-it-bleeds-it-leads” press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence—until panic breaks out.
The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially—in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate—until they run out of susceptible victims.
In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .
As in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.
Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and canceling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the corona virus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of “confirmed” cases—while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.
The New England Journal of Medicine writes , “Another Decade, Another Coronavirus.” This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.
This virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states virologist Steven Hatfill , but even there is unlikely to be effective—especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.The People’s Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.
A report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet , showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49) and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread .
The corona virus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .
In a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks—regular surgical masks are probably of little help.
Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.
Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family’s and their community’s survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.
For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly. Leave a Reply",FAKE
653,"A Highly-Compressed Wave-Form, Now Echoing: Corona Virus Vaccine (Months) Vs. Ebola Efforts (Decades)","To be fair, one cannot grow up a reliable vaccine, until the targeted virus is imaged, and sequenced, and known — with great specificity.
So it would take time, in any event. Loading that specific sequence of [killed] DNA proteins into a simian or bovine encapsulated viral shell, if you will, is now the likely preferred approach — to Corona- 2020. That said, the Ebola virus protein structure [and this approach] was well known [at least in Canada ], since the late 1970s. . . but a vaccine wasn’t finished until 2014.
Contrast that with Novel Corona- — just isolated a few months ago, but the work is already well-underway at JNJ, Merck-partner Moderna, the NIH and elsewhere. . . to solve the vaccine puzzle and arrest this outbreak.
[As a side bar, it seems former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD is at least obliquely criticizing the efforts of Seema Verna , at HHS — on speed of response, this time around.] In any event, see this, as an example of the typical MSM reporting :
. . . .[T]here are several other groups working on vaccines tailored to the new coronavirus. One team, from the National Institutes of Health and Moderna drug company, is also leveraging the similarities between the viruses and using other previous research toward a SARS vaccine as a template. (“I call it plug and play,” the lead scientist told the New York Times.) Will any of these end up working?
It will take a while to figure out — potentially longer than the new virus sticks around. Indeed, Hotez’s SARS vaccine is something of a warning of what happens to a promising vaccine once the issue at hand goes out of vogue: The funding dries up, and the vaccine goes to the back of the refrigerator. . . .
We will find the answer here — and it is true that commerce — trade with China [now threatened] is vastly larger, on a global scale — than trade with the DRC, Guinea or Sierra Leone. . . but that doesn’t make it. . . right . Onward, out into the sunshine here. Thinking of Albert, now five years, passed. . . . slightly sad, but a grin, for a full life. . . . Grin. . . .

826,"A Look at USA 2009 H1N1 Virus Compared to China 2020 Corona Virus : Vicious, Political & Xenophobic Racist Attacks Against China Needs To Stop","When the United States 2009 H1N1 swine flu emerged, an international emergency, a declared global pandemic, it eventually infected 60 million and initially killed a minimum of 18,449 cases that year. But the final story of the H1N1 global pandemic was far worse than that, with close to 300,000 deaths, according to the final tallies in 2012 reported by the CDC, as you will read below. Which is why I am scratching my head at how bizarrely negative forces are attacking China and Chinese people as it engages a remarkably aggressive front addressing this Corona virus outbreak which started in Wuhan, central China. I am forced to ask and answer a few questions. During 2009 H1N1 outbreak, I don't recall xenophobic anti-America attacks across the globe, do you? In fact, do you recall it took six months for the U.S. to declare a national emergency? Did any government from the onset in April 2009 through the end in April 2010, including the month of June, when H1N1 was declared an international emergency global pandemic, then send out a notice to its citizens that they should leave the United States? Close their borders to American travelers? Nope, not a peep. Like I said, something's not right, folks. I am reading hateful vicious attacks on the Chinese government for their supposed intentional conspiracy to intentionally under report the number of infections, yet that is exactly and always the case with such flu outbreaks no matter what country and the CDC reports illustrate that crystal clear. The U.S. H1N1 swine flu numbers were vastly underestimated and updated three years later, because dear friends, that is the nature of such viral outbreaks which don't care which country they started in. There is never enough man power, there are never enough test kits, there is never enough medicine or medical supplies. China is not trying to hide these hardships, they are well known, they are being reported on the news daily in China. There are always people who die, thousands of them whom we'll never know if they actually died because of a particular virus. Those are the facts, not any problem unique to China's healthcare system or government. Its not a conspiracy, its just tragedy. According to the June 27, 2012 research report followup three years later, it gets much more disturbing when you learn about the CDC's final estimate of the H1N1 virus global death toll. You and I find at this at this article at the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy website, the CDC's 18,449 total deaths number was ""...regarded as WELL BELOW THE TRUE TOTAL, mainly because many people who die of flu-related causes are not tested for the disease."" So during the 2009 outbreak, was anyone accusing the American medical and government authorities of hiding the numbers? Were Americans with hidden cameras strolling into the Mayo Clinic to PROVE how many people were really dying? The absurdity of these vicious attacks are that whether or not a person specifically does have the Corona virus or some other viral bug presenting as pneumonia, the treatment is the same supportive treatment anyway. Something's not right here folks. The world should be applauding China's unprecedented, broad, aggressive response. (WHO officials and many other government and healthcare officials across the globe are.) I am on the ground here in China READ IT HERE watching with my own eyes and it is quite incredible by any measure, not to mention an enormous economic sacrifice. Instead of looking at the will of an entire system of government acting faster than any other government on the planet could, we are one month later, still busy bashing a few local government officials in Wuhan who should have told us a couple weeks sooner. And yes, that is true those local officials screwed up. And by the way, those officials are in deep trouble for it. Just like the recent Puerto Rican politicians who are in trouble when we learned they didn't distribute hurricane emergency supplies that were sent to them to help during last year's terrible hurricane. A disgrace. Individual people screw up all the time and hopefully justice gets served later, but that's not an indictment of an entire country's government. Secondly, on this point, every provincial government has sent out a notice to its government officials pretty much saying that if they are stupid enough to do the same, they will face the wrath of harsh punishment. I don't doubt it for a moment. Lets contrast to what countless western politicians have gotten away with and remain in office to remind all of us that human error, stupidity and greed is not unique to any particular skin color or race or country. ""What about..."" reactions don't help. And here's the mic drop for you: ""The CDC researchers estimate that the H1N1 2009 pandemic virus caused 201,200 respiratory deaths and another 83,300 deaths from cardiovascular disease associated with H1N1 infections."" Total: 284,000 deaths. Shocking, isn't it? Was there a travel ban for any length of time to and from the United States? Did China, Germany, Japan or any other country close their border to American travelers? Today I noticed in the updates that following the United States Department of State policy suggesting U.S. citizens leave China, the United Kingdom embassy just released the same recommendation to subjects of the kingdom. In 2009, did UK subjects in America get a notice from their kingdom to leave America? No. Did the world suggest we isolate from America? Close the U.S. borders!? No. Did Americans get xenophobically attacked and targeted by anti-American sentiments like the Chinese are experiencing now? Um, no. Fascinating and disturbing to say the least. If you're an expat currently in China, unless you're in Wuhan, fact is that you're most likely safer and more peaceful and more stable by simply staying put than by leaving right now. You couldn't be safer than in this country, where almost everyone is staying home and dutifully isolating themselves with awareness. Not to mention that the Chinese government's decision to safeguard the society, the families, the people, is coming at a devastating economic cost in the hundreds of billions. I have a friend in Mesa, Arizona. He told me earlier that the big popular China City buffet, a huge busy place, has no customers. Does that make any sense at all? Let's test our ability to reason, to be rational: If you were in Miami and you heard that there was a virus outbreak that started in Milan, in central Italy, would you cancel your dinner reservation at the Italian restaurant that night in South Beach? No. Would you buy a pizza next week at Joey's Pizzeria in Delray Beach? If you were in Singapore and you heard there was a virus outbreak in Dallas, Texas in the central United States, would you stop going to your favorite local Texas southern BBQ restaurant with the owner from Houston, in Singapore? Would you avoid olive-skinned dark-haired Italian-looking people on the street in Chicago? Would you avoid big guys wearing cowboy hats, cuz they're obviously from Texas in Singapore cuz there's a virus in Dallas and they might have just gotten off the plane? There's a strange senseless bullying extremism and activism in today's society and you should do your best to avoid it and not be a part of it. It is fomented by a small group of extremist activists while definitely not supported by your average mainstream person who is simply exhausted by their outrage-inducing antics. Finally, here are some straight up, sensible accurate descriptions of this Corona virus which started in Wuhan, China. Its not called the China virus and neither was H1N1 called the America virus. Whether two weeks or two months from now, this flu season type virus will have passed and the joy of Spring will have arrived. Just like every flu season. However, don't misunderstand me. The extra caution and the remarkable response by the Chinese governments and people together to quell the spread of this virus was warranted because, yes it is correct that this corona virus is nastier than the usual annual flu bug, as was H1N1 in 2009. As of now, what we can confidently note the following regarding this Corona virus: This Corona virus is highly contagious, it spreads quite easily. It binds to lung tissue and so in particular, likes to cause pneumonia, that's what infection of lung tissue is. That's more severe than a respiratory infection which is only in your throat or bronchial tubes. The Corona virus currently has a 2% death rate. That's a lot higher, around 20x higher, than a more typical annual flu virus with a death rate of 0.1%. However, a 2% death rate is still much lower by comparison to the SARS virus which had a 9% death rate or the MERS virus with a really nasty 37% death rate. The Corona virus is causing severe symptoms in 10-15% of cases. 80% to 90% of deaths from this virus are happening in elderly patients, mostly with other existing health problems, not younger people. That characteristic by the way, is in contrast to the America 2009 H1N1 swine flu virus which in fact had a higher death rate amongst younger people including children rather than those over 60 years old. China identified and shared the Corona virus genome in record times, in only days and of course, immediately shared it with all international health and disease organizations. Medical researchers are already discovering that certain existing anti-viral medications seem to be effective against this Corona virus. Its impossible not to marvel at China's broad and aggressive domestic response directed by the provincial level governments to restrict movement, restrict transportation, restrict business for a period of time combined with the voluntary dutiful cooperation of its 1.3 billion citizens who are in the majority quietly staying at home these weeks to let the virus pass; this model response is already being hailed by the international community as a remarkable unprecedented response setting a new standard in understanding what is possible for future outbreaks in whatever country they may occur. Is it inconvenient and costly. You bet. Like I said, something's not right with the way humanity is responding to what's happening here. I haven't put my finger on it because well, its certainly complex and the world is upside down in many other ways that I also can't for the life of me understand or explain without ending up writing a very thick book. But I do know this: It needs to stop. This vicious, political, xenophobic racist attacks and smearing of all things China needs to stop. Its really not helping anyone in the political corridors of Washington nor is it doing anything to help the man on the street who is just concerned with taking care of his family. My family is originally from the Basilicata region of Italy, the little hillside Italian towns of Potenza and also, Grottola, which is just outside of Matera. They left their home country and moved to America where I was born, in Yonkers, New York. America became their home and it was my home until I left, too. Now over two decades ago, I left the United States, the country I was born in, the country that has plenty to admire and plenty to improve. But I left and I came to China and now China is my home. If you had asked me thirty years ago if this was my life plan on planet earth, I would have said you were nuts or a really bad fortune teller. But that's how it has turned out. I am truly blessed with my lovely Chinese wife and our family living here in Shenyang in China's northeast. You get my meaning? I am a mature adult like many with the powers of observation. I can easily see that whether we are talking about China or the United States or any other country, their societies and their governments have good points and bad points. The xenophobia needs to stop now. Whether in a couple of weeks or months later, this nasty flu type Corona virus will begin declining and the joy of Spring will arrive. Between now and then if you don't have anything good, anything supportive to say about China or Chinese people, how about you just keep your mouth shut. Mario Cavolo, Shenyang.",FAKE

150,Enforcement Policy for Imaging Systems During Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Emergency,"Docket Number: FDA-2020-D-1138 Issued by: Guidance Issuing Office Office of Medical Products and Tobacco, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of medical x-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging systems, and image analysis software that are used to diagnose and monitor medical conditions while mitigating circumstances that could lead to patient, healthcare provider, and healthcare technology management (HTM) exposure to COVID-19 for the duration of the public health emergency declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on January 31, 2020, effective January 27, 2020, and renewed for 90 days on April 21, 2020, effective April 26, 2020.
This policy is intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to COVID-19 declared by the HHS, including any renewals made by the HHS Secretary in accordance with section 319(a)(2) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 247d(a)(2)).
Given this public health emergency, and as discussed in the Notice in the Federal Register of March 25, 2020, titled "" Process for Making Available Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 ,"" this guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). This guidance document is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency's good guidance practices.

373,GenScript ProBio Screens anti-2019 nCoV Antibodies in Just 24 Hours,"escorted by public security officers, 8 transgenic mice for fully human antibodies immunized with antigen from 2019 nCoV from Rongchang District, Chongqing were brought by Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. to Nanjing . These ""anti-2019 nCoV"" mice are provided to GenScript Biologics Development Business Unit (now known as GenScript ProBio) for emergency antibody drug screening in response to 2019 nCoV pneumonia.
In 12 hours, GenScript ProBio successfully screened specific antibodies that recognize viral proteins and potentially block binding of virus to cellular receptors. In less than 24 hours, using the Beacon single-cell platform , GenScript ProBio completed immunized mice processing, immune cell isolation and enrichment, single cell sorting, on-chip binding and blocking screening, which usually takes three months using the traditional hybridoma antibody screening. This contributes to the breakthrough in anti-2019 nCoV antibody screening. GenScript is China's first CDMO company that applies the world's leading digital Beacon Platform in antibody discovery services.
In fact, as early as January 23 before the rapid outbreak, Discovery Department Head of GenScript ProBio, initiated the collaboration for an emergency screening project against 2019 nCoV together with Chongqing Academy of Animal Sciences and Chongqing CAMAB Biotech Ltd. The project team discussed the protocol details from antigen immunization to anti-2019 nCoV antibody characterization. For such emergency antibody drug project, the core lies in rapid antibody generation. This involves seamless integration of screening, sequencing and vector synthesis and further development to fight the 2019 nCoV outbreak. We finally worked out the optimal solution of rapid immunization coupled with GenScript ProBio Beacon single-cell platform screening and had multiple alternatives.
Dr. Brian Min , CEO of GenScript ProBio, said: ""Our mission is to accelerate drug development through innovation and collaboration. I am confident that we will defeat the virus by working diligently together with our customers.""
After successful antibody sequence screening, the team will work on expression of those antibody genes, and will perform further virus blocking and neutralization tests for the expressed antibodies. These Emergency antibodies after validation are expected to be put into mass production in GenScript ProBio to fight 2019 nCoV.
About GenScript ProBio:
GenScript ProBio is the CDMO segment of the world's leading biotech company GenScript, providing a one-stop biological drug research and development platform. GenScript ProBio's one-stop antibody drug development solutions include antibody drug discovery (hybridoma, phage display, full human and bispecific antibodies technologies), antibody engineering (antibody humanization, evaluation and optimization of drug compounds and affinity maturation) and other services.

903,Jackie Chan presents Rp 2.5 billion for those who can capture the Corona virus,"Home Lifestyle Health Jackie Chan presents Rp 2.5 billion for those who can capture the... Jackie Chan presents Rp 2.5 billion for those who can capture the Corona virus By 0 Jakarta –
Action movie star Jackie Chan offers a prize of 1 million yuan, almost the equivalent of 2.5 billion rupees, for the development of a new type of deterrent against the virus corona or 2019-nCoV.
Her latest film, Vanguard, was released in China because many people feared the spread of the corona virus in cinemas. He also wrote this concern in an article on Weibo, Chinese social media, which indicated that he would do something to help people affected by the plague in addition to entertaining them.
""Science and technology are the key to defeating the virus and I believe that many share the same ideas and I hope that the poison antidote can soon be developed,"" said the actor. 65 years old quoted by Strait News.
He has a rather ""crazy"" idea by offering compensation of a million yuan, as a thank you to those who have managed to find an antidote to the virus which has already infected more than 25,000 people today. .
""It's not nominal, it's just that I don't want to see the streets that used to be crowded go empty. I don't want my colleagues to fight the virus to death while they should enjoy life, ""he concluded.

676,Corona Virus,"Last month as the corona virus began to spread, I could hear the rumblings. All this wave of ‘hysteria’; whether it was through news sources or people just freaking out.
Yes, many things are upsetting about the virus. Take for example, the limitation one has to go outside and enjoy a sunny day at the park. Or go to a restaurant for one’s favourite food. It is an inconvenience, but as I was telling a colleague, “I rather you be bored, than infected!” dogonews.com
Another factor, the illness is easily transmittable; but one thing is important to recognize–a person has a chance of getting it between 0.021 to 0.025%; which means a person has 99.98% chance of recovery. That in itself is a positive inside a country of 1.4 billion people. That is why I love to follow the facts and numbers. Numbers don’t lie! Furthermore, I enjoy following the science. Better to follow the facts than become one of those in the desperation of hearsay and the rumour mill.
Important to consider, the respect for life and lives the virus has taken. Don’t risk it by being selfish, going outside when there is no need. You could get infected. If that is not a problem for you when solo, then fine, but please consider those around you. Follow the experts’ suggestions, they know better and these are implemented for a reason. Stay away from crowded areas, wear a mask (Replace it every four to eight hours and try whenever possible to wear an N-95 mask or any mask for that matter), wash your hands constantly, basically practice good hygiene, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. Practical advice. Then why take unnecessary risks to try and ‘challenge’ the odds.
If you’re not sure which advice to follow. Because the internet does have fake news and charlatans out there trying to provoke fear and havoc. My teachers in school taught me always to do research on three reliable/credible news sources and compare. In times like these it is important to use common sense and not desperation.
There are many things to be thankful for…
Reason number one: we are alive and kicking. This single statement gives us hope for today, possibly tomorrow and thereafter.
Reason number two: this is not the end of the world. As some people would like to believe, you know, like those who carry posters saying, “The end is nay!” or believe in Nostradamus . Well ladies and gents, it is not! Don’t overreact.
Reason number three: stay positive. Getting down and out depressed won’t help you or anybody around you. Being sad or desperate like the virus is contagious. Avoid it. Therefore, stay calm! Stay positive by reading your favourite book, watching your favourite series, doing your favourite exercise. Even when you have ‘cabin fever’, avoid it by playing card games, keeping distracted or walking from room to room for distraction. Meditate when you feel desperate, like when you want to scream or cry. Only do the latter as a release and once it doesn’t disturb others. We all have our days, but there are more positives in life than negatives. Remember that!
Reason number four: sleep eight-and-half hours. Sleep will help improve your mood. Lack of it will make any person irritable and unhappy. Too much of it, might get you depressed.
Reason number five: try to build a routine to help improve your health and feelings about the situation. If you have food around, internet, you’re staying communicated, there’s a roof over your head, a warm bed to sleep in–hey, you’re luckier than 70% of the people around the world who don’t have that and live in poverty.
To conclude, there are things about the virus and how it was handled since its conception we may not agree with. There is no time for that, there is the present. This is a time for unity-solidarity and to look at the bright side, how it has been contained or quarantined to avoid further spreading. With this in mind, chin-up!

903,"Corona-phobia: Like SARS, coronavirus fear feeds racism","I went home and wiped every item I had bought. And then I thought, ""You bl**dy fool, Zulfikar! You bl**dy racist fool!""
Read more: German coronavirus evacuee describes life in quarantine
That poor couple, out doing the weekly shop like me, must have felt so objectified and they may not have even been Chinese, or from Wuhan. Or again, like me, a half-Indian who's never been to India, they may have never visited the country of their parents or grandparents birth.
Corkscrew of fear and loathing
The current case of coronavirus is a little complicated.
To start with we're dealing with a relatively unknown virus. Scientists don't know enough to understand how it spreads or develops, and as a result, how it can be stopped. And that sense of ""unknown unknowns,"" to misquote yet again, this time former US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , is a natural breeding ground for fear, irrational feelings of distrust, disgust, hate, racism and xenophobia.
That U.N. report describes xenophobia as including behavior that rejects, excludes and vilifies people ""based on the perception "" that they are ""outsiders."" Medically justified as they may be, national programs that remove and quarantine ""plane loads"" of people from Wuhan to Australia's Christmas Island or to military bases in the UK feeds into such perceptions.
As with the Biblical reference, Rumsfeld was not for nothing either. Rumsfeld and the George Bush Junior administration he served between 2001 and 2006 used that sense of unknown threats to leverage support for a Middle East war and an Islamophobia, encouraged with images of bearded Muslim bogeymen, which quickly transpired.
As far away from China as El Salvador: Thermographic imaging of air travellers
But then, when it comes to China, what extra leverage do people need?
We in the ""West"" already harbor feelings of distrust and xenophobia against the Chinese state and the people who live there — whether they're Chinese or not. We're perfectly happy to buy the iPhones they manufacture, but we sure as Hinnom don't want the Chinese firm Huawei anywhere near our 5G networks . They will spy on us, surely.
And it's happened before
The trouble is, we often don't even realize we're doing it. Which is part of the same kind of complacency and idiocy inherent in racism itself. So, for instance, UC Berkley may have thought it was doing students a favor when the university's health center said that ""normal reactions"" to coronavirus included panic, anger, hyper-vigilance to health and … wait for it … xenophobia.
But is it really? Normal? I suppose if a lot of people feel that way, you could say it is kind of normal. But that doesn't make it right. UC Berkeley was accused of ""normalizing racism"" (as reported in the The Washington Post ) and apologized for the advice (my emphasis).
Only I would say a certain level of normalization is necessary. Without normalization, we can go on refusing to accept that racism or xenophobia, and the irrational psychological feelings that feed them, exist and need to be handled head-on.
After all, we have been here before. In 2004, a year after the outbreak of SARS in Asia, researchers wrote about "" SARS-related fear, stigmatization, and discrimination ."" In an opinion piece for The New York Times , Iris Chang wrote about "" Fear of SARS, Fear of Strangers ,"" and led with a line about UC Berkeley (them again?) banning students from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore from all its summer programs.
And those left behind in Wuhan ... Left to clean and rid the city of the virus
Avoidance psychology
But these feelings of fear work like a corkscrew — they drill deep and risk fracturing any brittle constitution. These feelings can also endanger the perpetrators themselves.
In 2004, a paper about the "" psychology behind the masks "" referred to ""two diseases looming"" — one, the virus itself and two, that of a psychological nature. The authors write about ""panic-stricken people"" mobbing stores after a fake news article said Hong Kong would be sealed off from the world. Then, a man from Taiwan committed suicide in a hospital ward because he suspected family members had contracted the then-fatal virus. An evident, yet anecdotal, SARS-phobia was rearing its head. Now we have Corona-phobia.
None of this helps anyone. In fact, it's like the 1980s panic around HIV. The unthinking among us believed we could only get HIV if we were gay or bisexual. But as early as 1988 researchers knew that wasn't true . Watch video 01:07",FAKE
145,Kash Doll makes a racist anti-asian joke about the Corona Virus," Fair enough, it is definitely more transmissible since people haven't had a chance to develop immunities.I'm kind of ambivalent about the reported death rate. Because so many people are not officially diagnosed/counted, the death rate is potentially a lot less. People with worse cases are more likely to show up to the doctor/hospital and be counted and die. People with milder symptoms might mistake it for a bad cold/flu and be fine afterwards and never counted. Of course, this could go the other way, but I think that people going to doctor in the worst case is more likely than staying home. Risk of dying outside of China is less than 1%. I imagine a lot of the problem in China is/was the information shutdown, intense population density, and overwhelmed/unprepared health systems.I just feel like people overreact to a danger that isn't likely to affect them while ignoring more present, more pressing dangers.

993,The BIG impact of Coronavirus – The changes Covid-19 will force on to the business of Bollywood and a possible view of the future – Part 2,"The on-going lockdown due to the Coronavirus outbreak has affected all industries across the globe. But entertainment is one of the industries that has got majorly impacted, arguably like never before. In most places, as cases increased, cinema halls were the first ones to shut and since it comes under the non-essential category, once the lockdown will be lifted, it’ll be the last ones to start operations. Shootings too came to a halt and also other filmmaking work like post-production, casting etc. As a result, the losses faced by the industry are insurmountable. Some of the important voices have already made it clear that things won’t be the same again in a lot of respects. Brace for a ‘new normal’ is what they say.
Fears of increase in clashes at the box office
Taking the 2009 scenario once again in focus, it was seen at that point how a lot of films scrambled to come in cinemas, resulting in several clashes. The fear is that post-lockdown future will also see a repeat of that phenomenon. Taran Adarsh fears, “I foresee a very chaotic scenario. Not just Hindi, but Hollywood films, Tamil, Telugu, Punjabi film etc would also be releasing. As far as Hindi films are concerned, I guess that the makers of big films would chalk out dates and discuss amicably.” Manoj Desai minces no words as he says, “ Agar producer aur distributor ke paas dimaag hai, toh saath mein nahi aana chahiye . They should space out the releases.” Shibashish Sarkar too hopes there’s no conflict over release dates, “I hope that everybody would be sensible and make a space for each other. Everybody hopefully will sacrifice and adapt to each other’s requirements.”
Akshaye Rathi comprehensively elaborates, “In this scenario, the entire value chain will have to work as one unit. No producer or exhibitor can afford any cannibalization of revenues. Before the theatres open, entities like IMPPA, Producer’s Guild, MPA etc will have to sit and work around in ensuring that clashes are minimized and nobody gets into these stupid ego wars of clashing with another film and trying to arm-twist exhibitors. It has to be a scenario where every tent pole film has to be given the maximum scope of generating revenue and every cinema in the country that runs that film should be given the maximum chance to monetize it best. So associations should ensure that every tent pole release should come 2 weeks apart from each other. The smaller films can come together as they can be accommodated simultaneously. So, a Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai coming with a Laxmmi Bomb is not an advisable scenario because we need to milk Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai to the maximum and then we also need to milk Laxmmi Bomb to the optimum! Even 10% cannibalization by one movie into the other can prove detrimental in this condition.”
While the single-screens and trade fear that clashes might be inevitable, the multiplex sector on the other hand doesn’t feel threatened over this issue. Kamal Gianchandani says, “In any case, it’s become a norm to release multiple films on a holiday. But compared to 2009, now we have more capacity. The number of screens has grown manifold. So accommodating more films in a particular week is not a problem. Two big films have been releasing regularly. Even this Eid, Akshay Kumar’s Laxmmi Bomb and Salman Khan’s Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai were supposed to arrive on the same day and that too with Fast & Furious 9! Even in Tamil and Telugu, there would have been some clashes. So release of multiple films, across languages, on a big holiday is already a norm. We don’t think that the situation will get any worse as there are enough screens to accommodate multiple movies.”
While big films might still survive in the clash of the titans, it is the smaller films that can get crushed. Producer Anand Pandit explains, “I worry for the smaller projects and smaller production houses. Success in this industry depends a lot on keeping the lid on budgets and getting the maximum out of the investment. There may be some who may have borrowed, some who may have sold assets. There will be others who may have worked tirelessly for the past several months even a year, possibly without making any money, waiting for that big payday. New projects will take time to be greenlit. Now they are all stuck. The uncertainty is quite daunting to put it mildly.”
OTT to come to the rescue for smaller films?
Recently, Bamfaad , the launch vehicle of Paresh Rawal’s son Aditya, got a direct release on the OTT portal Zee5 over fears that it might not find enough screens later on. So will more small films skip theatrical release and opt for OTT? Taran Adarsh says, “There’s a possibility that some small films might directly come on OTT. If you release your film on the web directly, then you won’t earn from theatrical. At the same time, for how long can the small films hold on? In Hollywood, they can hold on for a longer time but what about our producers?”
Girish Johar makes a valid point, “Smaller producers who have made films for less than say Rs. 10 crore, they’ll not be able to sustain the delay as they are burdened with the rising costs. So they might opt for distress sale of their film to the OTT platforms. Toh unko thodi bahut maar padegi hi padegi . But to each, its own. If a producer feels that putting his film directly on OTT will mitigate his expenses, then why not? Having said that, I feel that India is a traditionally film going market. The validation that one gets of a film being hit or flop at the box office is something that every producer, director, actor, writer etc wants.”
Akshaye Rathi too agrees as he says, “It’ll be a case-to-case scenario. A lot of filmmakers realize the premium value that a theatrical run brings to it. When cinemas open up, I believe that the producers will have way more lucrative benefits of going for a theatrical release. I can’t say what those benefits would be because that would be formulated and regulated. But I can tell you one thing for sure is that, theatres will do whatever it takes to support producers and vice versa.”
Shibashish Sarkar too thinks in the same wavelength, “Disney has decided to take Artemis Fowl straight to digital, on Disney+. Disney CEO Bob Iger has admitted that some of their other films might also release on the internet but they’ll hold some of their films for theatrical release. Same goes for Universal Studios. They released Trolls World Tour directly on OTT. But they’ll release some of their big-ticket movies on the big screen first. We are content makers and for us, some films might seem fit for OTT while some would be ideal for theatrical release. It depends on the producers to take a call. If a few films jump the theatrical release and are streamed digitally, then that’s fair enough. But there are some films that are made for the big screen and community experience. And these films will be held until theatrical opens up. If you ask me, all our films have been reserved for theatrical.”
Amod Mehra however comes up with an unconventional point of view on this topic, “The question is not whether the filmmakers want to give their small films on OTT. The question is whether OTT platforms are interested in buying these films. Why would they pay these filmmakers when there’s no shortage of content for them? The platforms will be desperate for these films only when there’s a dearth of content. Also, these portals are more interested in web series rather than films. Also, only films with bigger stars are consumed most of the times.”
At present, every filmmaker signs a contract with multiplex chains whereby they agree that they’ll release their on the OTT only 8 weeks after release. Is there a possibility that this gap might be reduced? Kamal Gianchandani makes it clear that he’s not expecting any change. But Shibashish Sarkar tells, “It will be a discussion for the future. 6 or 9 months down the line, we’ll have to see how theatrical or OTT models are working. And it’s not cast in stone that a film can come on OTT only after 8 weeks. It was followed at a certain point of time and it’s only in the future that we can figure out whether or not there will be a discussion on this subject. Right now, the focus is only to start the life again”
Change in film budgets; pay-cut for actors on the anvil?
The pandemic has led to shootings getting disrupted like never before. In such a scenario, there’s a possibility of budgets being redrawn and an increase in the cost of the films under production due to increased cost of financing. And this might lead to actors taking a pay cut or opting for profit sharing. Taran Adarsh explains, “Everyone will have to pitch in. Those days are gone when stars would adamantly say that they won’t reduce their price. I am sure things are going to undergo a drastic change.” Amod Mehra says, “All films will have to rework on their subject, number of days of shooting etc. It’ll be different for each though and one can’t generalize.”
Girish Johar explains, “Even South has started to mitigate its losses by dubbing their films in Hindi and other languages and releasing in cinemas. Recently, Allu Arjun announced that his new film Pushpa will also release in Hindi. At the end of the day, creating a noise also has a value. Meaning, you’ll have to spend a lot on P&A in order to stand out. And this will make the scenario riskier for the producers. The actors’ fees and those of director, especially if they are reputed, form large components of the budget. So their pay is a key component that has to be reduced so that everyone is able to breathe easy and comfortably tide over this difficult time”
Shibashish Sarkar meanwhile, gives a detailed reply, “We can say that only when the new normalcy kicks in. We are probably looking at a situation that the domestic theatrical business will be less than what it was in a normal situation. Maybe, the collections can even be more than before! After all, people are all bored sitting at home and wanting to go out like before. Even in the past, this has happened many times when after a catastrophe or recession, the footfalls have increased manifold. But assuming that the situation is not favourable in terms of revenue expectation, then I believe all talents, HODs, technicians etc will have to opt for a pay cut. Why just actors? The producer will have to do everything to make the ends meet. And for that, everyone will have to take a cut in their profit margins. But I reiterate, these discussions will open up only at a later date because right now, we don’t even know how things are going to pan out.”
Question mark on foreign shoots
With the situation being much more alarming internationally, can we expect less foreign shoots in our films? Anand Pandit says, “Shoots will need to be rescheduled. New dates will need to be obtained. Actors will need to juggle their dairies. New locations will need to be recced keeping in mind travel restrictions. A lot of shoots are planned abroad keeping in mind the local subsidy available. Now that may or may not be available or even be an option. So the budgets will need to be reworked. More importantly, we would need to start thinking of the safety of the entire unit while choosing foreign location. Accordingly, some scripts will need to be tweaked and altered a bit. Some producers may even need to reshoot certain portions of their films.”
Girish Johar agrees, “In India, the pandemic is very much in control and we are pretty much at ease, as compared to other parts of the world. The government’s strict measures have ensured that it has not caused widespread panic. But the situation is worse in USA and many parts of Europe. They will take much longer to come to normalcy. So if shoots resume say in July, I doubt any producer will decide to go to UK to shoot in August to take advantage of the rebate. Going there might be safe but filmmakers would rather not take the risk and instead shoot in India itself.”
Shibashish Sarkar however makes a contrary observation, “In terms of timeline when shooting may start, we need to wait and evaluate options. All the countries or all the states have been coping differently. We definitely need to wait till the health crisis is over and lockdown opens up, especially the travel restrictions. There are some countries or states which will reach normalcy stage sooner than other. So there will be countries which will bounce back before India. Similarly there will be countries which will take more time. For instance, till now, the disease has not fortunately struck so badly in African countries. We need to see whether it remains controlled in future. Also, in some of the South East Asian countries, their peak was probably before it was in India. It’s likely that restrictions there will be eased out before. So, in some nations, permissions for shooting will be granted even before India. If someone wants to shoot in those countries, if the story allows, and if travel restrictions eased out, it can be possible that probably shoot can start earlier in some other countries. That might not be the case for European or North American nations. The same might hold true even at a state level within the country. Some states probably will come back to normalcy before others. However, whether the shoot takes place in our country or abroad, we’ll all have to gear up for a new reality. The units will be smaller, the members will have to follow much more social hygiene conducts, wear masks, use sanitizers, practice social distancing etc”
Rise in social distancing = fall in intimate scenes?
Taran Adarsh exults, “The two words ‘social distancing’ dimaag mein chhap chuke hai . This entire habit of staying away from people will take time to go away.” In this regard, even shooting sets will have to practice safety measures strictly. So will that led to reduction of kissing or any form of intimacy on screen? Girish Johar laughs and disagrees, “I don’t think kissing scenes will reduce or that there would be only zoomed out scenes!” In a lighter vein he says, “Or it might be like Amitabh Bachchan’s short film Family .”
An amused Kamal Gianchandani says, “I don’t think so. From 100% social distancing to 0% social distancing will take time. There’ll be a transition. But at some time, we’ll get back to normal. At some point, there’ll be a vaccine and thus, the disease will be eradicated totally. But even in the transition phase, I am sure that the necessary precautions can be taken. And if there’s a requirement to show intimate scenes, I am sure it’ll be possible to do so.”
Amod Mehra says, “I don’t think the actors will be ready to do a kissing scene unless the script drastically demands it. This used to happen with pornographic films also. Sunny Leone has said it in many interviews that she had to show a medical certificate to prove that she doesn’t have a STD. So similarly, actors will need a certificate that states that he/she is fit and doesn’t have cough or cold”
Akshaye Rathi makes a valid observation, “I’m pretty sure nothing of that sort is going to happen and the Indian censor board will have a lot of work to do! There are so many films that are already been made. And for the ones that haven’t been made, I don’t think it makes any difference at all. Before going for that kind of shots, perhaps the actors will go through a sanitization tunnels. So I am sure such measures will be implemented. Also, by that logic, action scenes bhi nahi ho sakte na? Agar main kisi ko punch karunga, toh mere toh haath lag gaya na uss aadmi ko !” Taran Adarsh too agrees on the later part, “Why just lovemaking? Even action sequences or emotional sequences of a parent hugging a child or dramatic sequence, which demand an actor to hold someone, everything will undergo a massive change.”
Conclusion
Tough times lay ahead but the industry seems to be united like never before. No one exactly knows what the future holds but one thing is for sure – everyone is ready to co-operate to each other till things ease out. “The fact remains that the industry will need to come together as one and give each other a helping hand. We will have to be more united than ever before. Perhaps this may be a time for the industry look at their costs, fees and margins. It's not the same world anymore,” says Anand Pandit and serves well as the last word. ",FAKE
355,Interesting Psak: Shul and the Corona Virus,"Feb 5, 2020 Interesting Psak: Shul and the Corona Virus This is a bit too brief for my liking, but Actualic bring an interesting psak about going to shul during this scare of the Corona Virus. According to the report, some Jews from China sent a question to a special beis din in Bnei Braq established to deal with medical issues and halacha headed by Rav Shmuel Eliezer Stern. These Jews in China are concerned about the spread of this dangerous Corona Virus and want to know if they should continue to go to shul to daven with a minyan or if they should avoid it out of fear of getting infected with the virus? The answer from the beis din was that we have to be more stringent regarding situations of danger than regarding situations of transgressing prohibitions. Ergo, if there is even a slight concern about the virus spreading and getting infected by going to shul,. one should not go to the shul. I guess this means it is not a blanket hetter to stay home, but if in the location where any specific person is there is a valid concern of the virus, one should stay home. If where you are there has been no virus and there is no real concern, then go to shul. Rav Chaim Kanievsky, and other rabbonim, have been asked similar questions and have answered similarly, adding that the professional authorities dealing with the issues should be listened to and instructions followed to avoid getting exposed to the virus. Everyone should stay healthy! ",FAKE
240,Terumo BCT’s Mirasol reduces the virus causing COVID-19 below the limit of detection in plasma and platelets,"A study published today in peer-reviewed Vox Sanguinis shows Terumo BCT's Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelet products to undetectable levels. Mirasol is designed to add an extra layer of safety to the blood supply. In some parts of the world, where Mirasol is approved for use, the device is used to treat convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients. [1] LAKEWOOD, CO. USA – 23 April 2020 – Today, Vox Sanguinis , a peer-reviewed medical journal, published results from a Terumo BCT study conducted in collaboration with top researchers at Colorado State University . The study examined how well the Mirasol system treated platelets and plasma against the virus causing COVID-19.
The results showed that Mirasol is effective against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, when high virus levels are present in human plasma and platelets.
Study Results [2] In the Terumo BCT study, the measured titer of SARS-CoV-2 was below the limit of detection in tissue culture following treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light on the Mirasol system. The mean log reductions in the viral titers were ≥ 3.40 and ≥ 4.53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively.
Mirasol effectively reduced the titer of SARS-CoV-2 in both plasma and platelets to undetectable levels. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion-transmitted SARS-CoV-2.
Changing World = Emerging Pathogens Pathogen reduction with Mirasol is a method to address emerging and evolving pathogens as the rate of epidemics increases, people travel more and the global climate warms.
“Mirasol adds a layer of safety to blood products by reducing the risk of transfusion transmission of both known and emerging pathogens,"" says Shawn D. Keil, Scientific Affairs, Terumo BCT, and lead author of the publication. “SARS-CoV-2 won’t be the last novel virus to emerge. Using the Mirasol PRT system is a proactive approach to protecting the foundation of healthcare, blood.”
Dr. Louis Katz, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Mississippi Valley Regional Blood Center , Davenport, Iowa, U.S.A., said: “Once more, in the aftermath of HIV and HCV [the hepatitis C virus], we are reminded that a proactive intervention like pathogen reduction could be of value in urgent and emergent circumstances like the current pandemic.”
Pathogen Reduction and Convalescent Plasma People who have recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies to the disease in their blood. Some healthcare providers are using convalescent plasma for patients with severe COVID-19 to boost their ability to fight the virus. [3] Others are considering using convalescent plasma to provide passive immunity to healthcare workers, such as doctors and nurses who have been exposed to the virus but are not showing symptoms. Mirasol may add an extra layer of safety to convalescent plasma, even though there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through transfusion.
""The proactive value of pathogen reduction providing blood safety in the event of unknown pathogen outbreaks is shown in this awful COVID-19 pandemic. The riboflavin technology inactivates the SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, so it should be especially helpful in the treatment of COVID-19 convalescent plasma and to provide additional safety for standard blood products,"" Dr. Jeffrey McCullough, MD, Professor Emeritus, University of Minnesota Medical School .*
About Mirasol Using riboflavin (vitamin B2) and ultraviolet light, Mirasol is designed to reduce the pathogen load of various disease-causing agents such as viruses, parasites and bacteria in blood products before they are transfused to patients. Mirasol also inactivates white blood cells to help reduce certain transfusion reactions.
Mirasol is CE marked for platelets, plasma and whole blood and is in routine use in more than 20 countries throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America. The system is not approved for sale in the U.S. and Canada.
There are no approved devices or therapies for specific treatment of COVID-19.

Amidst the outbreak of the horrid Corona Virus , news agencies have been reporting daily about how this vicious virus is claiming so many lives and how rapidly it is infecting people. The point of the post is to spread awareness. So please read until the end and share it with someone you know.
I have a sister and two nieces who are abroad. They are based In Hubei, Wuhan; the city mostly affected by this virus. The city is on lock down. Nobody can enter or leave. You need a permit to drive In public. The city is literally quarantined. People are dying; falling whilst waiting to get seen to. Hospitals are packed to capacity. Healthcare workers, no no rather heros, are working around the clock to ensure they cure and see to as many people as they can. I feel like I’m writing a script to a movie.
No doubt that their safety is my biggest concern. But further to that, it is our safety. If Shanghai has declared a level 1 emergency on this (the highest level), why aren’t we seeing preventative posts here In South Africa? I mean people are constantly traveling to and from China. It kinda is no wonder though, when our government doesn’t even care much about its citizens abroad.
Latest stats What’s even more alarming is that every other continent has recorded cases of infected people except us here in Africa… One case was earlier brought to light but no confirmation on whether it was the virus or not. Are there really no records or is something being hushed? I suppose that’s a conversation for another day. But something just doesn’t add up.
The point of this post though is to spread awareness though, so let’s get back to topic.
Keep your immune systems strong. You can do that by staying hydrated, getting enough sleep, eating more fresh fruits and veggies. You can take vitamin c supplements and other multi vitamins. Excersise often and just stay healthy.
All images are courtesy of Google Another important part of this is hygiene. Sanatize all your belongings atleast twice a day. Use alcohol based hand Sanatizer. Keep it with you. If you go to gym, wipe those machines down and sanatize before and after. If you don’t have Sanatizer, you mix a cap of detol to 400mls of water and spray it over your belongings. Or even use ammonia based products such as bleach and or Domestos.
Spread this as it could help save someone’s life.
The Corona virus is said to be 10 times worse than the SARS virus and scientists estimate that it will only start dying down In May. May God keep all those abroad safe and keep their families here at home calm. Aameen

781,"Experts issue guide on lung screening, management during COVID-19","A new expert panel consensus statement published simultaneously today in the journals Radiology: Imaging Cancer, Chest and the Journal of the American College of Radiology provides guidance to clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. In many parts of the world, the COVID-19 public health crisis has stressed the health care system close to or even past its breaking point. Hospital resources are focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically ill. The strain on health care systems and the need to control the virus using containment and mitigation has impacted the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary exams against the risk of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings or exposing health care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including hospital personnel, to evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.
""The potential risk of exposure or transmission during routine care, as well as the diversion of resources to help combat the pandemic, has forced clinicians to make decisions about the timing of care,"" said Peter J. Mazzone, M.D., M.P.H., FCCP, director of the Lung Cancer Program and Lung Cancer Screening Program for the Cleveland Clinic Respiratory Institute. ""This document provides guidance that we hope will help with these decisions. It outlines acceptable variances from standard practice during the pandemic and provides items to consider that could influence the decisions for a given patient.""
Performing a lung cancer screening exam or the evaluation of lung nodules both carry additional risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is added risk to the patient, other patients and health care providers from exposure to the health care environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection may be influenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of benefit and harm struck by current (pre-COVID) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in health care resources, toward canceling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where
COVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more difficult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to suggest that non-urgent care be deferred.
To date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and lung nodule management programs during the pandemic. The consensus statement was developed to provide expert opinion to clinicians regarding the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with lung nodules in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance. Three project leaders and 21 panel members participated in developing the consensus statement. Their specialties included pulmonology, thoracic radiology and thoracic surgery. Twelve scenarios were developed, each with a statement requiring a vote. The voting results for all statements exceeded the threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree. Scenarios recommendations and notes are included in the report.
Consensus was unanimous for recommendations to delay baseline or repeat annual screening, and over 95% of panelists agreed to delay the evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected incidentally or by screening that have a low probability of cancer or are likely to be an indolent cancer.
Consensus was less uniform but still strong for recommendations to delay or modify the evaluation and management of patients with nodules measuring greater than 8 millimeters in average diameter.
The authors note that these recommendations are not ""one-size-fits-all"" and state that patient preferences should be considered in all of the scenarios, because individual patients are likely to differ in how they perceive the potential benefits and harms associated with delayed or modified evaluation and management.
The paper points out that due to the fluidity of the situation, it is not possible at this time to determine when it will be advisable to return to usual care practices.
""We hope these statements are helpful and provide some reassurance and direction to individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening, patients with lung nodules, and the clinicians who care for them,"" the authors conclude.

262,Health Ministry confirms two more cases of Covid-19,"Two 50-year-old men from Birgunj tested positive for the virus on Sunday
The Health ministry on Sunday confirmed two more cases of novel coronavirus in Parsa district, taking Nepal ’s Covid-19 tally to 51.
“Samples tested at the National Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu confirmed Covid-19 in two men, both 50 years of age,” the ministry said in a statement . “Both are Birgunj residents.”
The two men have been kept in an isolation facility in Parsa and their health condition is normal, according to the ministry.
On April 12, three Indian nationals residing in Birgunj had tested positive for Covid-19. They are at the isolation facility in Narayani hospital.
The new cases were reported just a day before the end of the national lockdown imposed since March 24 to contain the spread of the virus.
A Cabinet meeting scheduled today will decide on whether to extend the lockdown and the modality for it.
More than a month into lockdown, there have been calls from some sections to ease the lockdown by assessing the situation in the areas where more Covid-19 cases have been reported.
On Saturday, the Health Ministry had recommended extending lockdown by at least a week or allowing provincial governments to take a decision on their own.
Given the rising number of cases and Indian lockdown until May 3, officials say the government is likely to extend the lockdown at least by a week.
Meanwhile, calls have also grown for expanding polymerase chain reaction tests and expedite contact tracing.
The National Human Rights Commission on Saturday drew the government's attention to the efficacy of rapid diagnostic tests and called for conducting more PCR tests.
Frequently asked questions about the coronavirus outbreak
UPDATED as of April 26, 2020
What is Covid-19? Covid-19, short for coronavirus disease, is an illness caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, short for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Common symptoms of the disease include fever, dry cough, fatigue, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
How contagious is Covid-19? Covid-19 can spread easily from person to person, especially in enclosed spaces. The virus can travel through the air in respiratory droplets produced when a sick person breathes, talks, coughs or sneezes. As the virus can also survive on plastic and steel surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours, any contact with such surfaces can also spread the virus. Symptoms take between two to 14 days to appear, during which time the carrier is believed to be contagious.
Where did the virus come from? The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in late December. The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that is responsible for everything from the common cold to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). After an initial outbreak in Wuhan that spread across Hubei province, eventually infecting over 80,000 and killing more than 3,000, new infection rates in mainland China have dropped. However, the disease has since spread across the world at an alarming rate.
What is the current status of Covid-19?
The World Health Organisation has called the ongoing outbreak a “pandemic” and urged countries across the world to take precautionary measures. As of Friday, Covid-19 had spread to 210 countries and infected more than 2,876,701 people with 201,534 deaths. In South Asia, India has reported the highest number of infections at 24,342 with 779 deaths. While Pakistan has reported 12,227 confirmed cases with 256 deaths. Nepal has so far reported 52 cases, in which 16 patients recovered .
How dangerous is the disease?
The mortality rate for Covid-19 is estimated to be 3.6 percent, but new studies have put the rate slightly higher at 5.7 percent. Although Covid-19 is not too dangerous to young healthy people, older individuals and those with immune-compromised systems are at greater risk of death. People with chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes and lung disease, or those who’ve recently undergone serious medical procedures, are also at risk.
How do I keep myself safe? The WHO advises that the most important thing you can do is wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol content. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unclean hands. Clean and disinfect frequently used surfaces like your computers and phones. Avoid large crowds of people. Seek medical attention if symptoms persist for longer than a few days.
Is it time to panic?
No. Th e government has imposed a lockdown to limit the spread of the virus. T here is no need to begin stockpiling food, cooking gas or hand sanitizers. However, it is always prudent to take sensible precautions like the ones identified above. Related News ",REAL
737,English River FN makes ‘urgent call for support’ from province to help control COVID-19 spread ,"As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to spread in the Far North region of Saskatchewan, the English River First Nation “is making an urgent call for support to help control and eradicate the current spread of the virus in their communities,” they said in a statement.
“As case numbers rapidly increase in the Far North, we hope the Saskatchewan Government is laser-focused on the need to help us stem the spread up here,” ERFN Councillor Katrina Maurice said in the statement.
First Nations communities are particularly vulnerable to the spread and impact of viruses because of systemic issues around overcrowding, food insecurity, and underfunded and inferior healthcare systems, the statement added.
The Far North region, where the English River First Nation is located, is being hit the hardest by COVID-19 in the province. Of the 57 active cases currently in Saskatchewan, 32 of those are in the Far North. All four of the COVID-19 cases in English River were confirmed this week.
“As Saskatchewan descends their curve, we are just starting our ascent,” ERFN Pandemic Planning Committee Emergency Coordinator Bernie Eaglechild said. “As we have witnessed around the world, the shape of each curve was determined by the population’s resources and how quickly they were executed, so we are welcoming any and all of the support we can get to determine the extent of the spread in our communities.”
Contact tracing from the positive cases has already been done, but officials said there could be more cases in the community. ",REAL

313,AntiCancer Inc. to Target Its Oral Recombinant Methioninase Against 2019-nCoV Coronavirus,"Currently there are no therapies or vaccines for patients infected with 2019-nCoV coronavirus around the world. As the number of 2019-nCoV patients approaches 10,000 and more than 200 deaths, with both numbers rapidly climbing, without the prospect of a vaccine for at least a year, the situation is becoming dire.
AntiCancer’s oral recombinant methioninase targets and destroys circulating methionine in the body. Methionine is a common amino acid derived from protein-containing food. Oral methioninase has been shown to have great promise for treating cancer, obesity and diabetes by restricting methionine in the body. It is known that virally-infected cells are killed by methionine restriction. Importantly, coronaviruses have a specific requirement for methionine in order to replicate and to evade the immune system of the host.
“Oral recombinant methioninase has high potential to slow or arrest infection of 2019-nCoV in patients, with and without symptoms,” said Dr. Qinghong Han, methioninase project leader at AntiCancer. “We will first test methioninase in cultured lung cells infected with 2019-nCoV in vitro, and then test oral recombinant methioninase in patients infected with the virus. We will carry out these tests in China with the appropriate organizations and safety profiles. Oral recombinant methioninase should be effective therapy for 2019-nCoV disease since coronaviruses have a special requirement for methionine,” said Dr. Han.
AntiCancer will collaborate with its sister company in Beijing, AntiCancer Beijing, to develop oral recombinant methioninase for 2019-nCoV in China. AntiCancer Inc. is based in San Diego and has subsidiaries in Tokyo, Seoul and Nanjing in addition to Beijing.",REAL

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the first cases of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the U.S. near Seattle, Washington State, and Chicago.
The CDC has confirmed that there is limited person-to-person spread, but it is still unclear how this virus is spreading between people. While severe illness, including illness resulting in a number of deaths has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. The CDC is closely monitoring the situation and is working with the World Health Organization (WHO). It is important to know that based on current information, the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is deemed to be low at this time.
All individuals visiting Schiffert Health Center are screened prior to their appointment for any recent international travel. Those who have traveled from China to the U.S. will be asked questions about their health and travel history. Schiffert Health Center advises anyone to seek medical care and alert a healthcare provider that has traveled to Wuhan City within the past 14 days and is experiencing a fever with or without respiratory symptoms.

917,WHO declares global health emergency over 2019-nCOV,"The new coronavirus (2019-nCOV) has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China. ""The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries,"" said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, according to the BBC. The concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems. The UN agency said the new coronavirus has been exported to more than a dozen countries, now including India and the Philippines which have the latest cases. The agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response, according to the Associated Press. The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China in late December. To date, China has reported more than 7,800 cases including 170 deaths. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. There is now evidence that the virus is spreading among people in China and health experts have noted with concern instances in other countries — including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, and Vietnam — where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission. “This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China...on the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak,” the WHO chief said. With WHO declaring a global health emergency comes certain requirements and typically the declaration also brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. Several countries, including the United States, Japan and some in the European Union, are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan. The United Kingdom was given the green light to fly nationals home in the early hours of Friday morning after a long delay. A number of other countries, including Russia and Mongolia, have closed their borders while many airlines are suspending flights to and from China. This is a developing story.",REAL
882,New Corona Virus spreading in China,"China reported 17 new cases of infection by a new corona virus in Wuhan on January 19, including three in a severe condition. Those infected range from 30 to 79 years old. The virus has now infected 62 people in Wuhan, city authorities said, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation receiving treatment. Cases were also reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen as hundreds of million of Chinese are traveling home to celebrate the Spring Festival on January 25. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the new virus is not SARS, and dismissed claims there has been a cover-up in the reporting of cases outside Wuhan. However, the South China Morning Post report that a doctor in Shanghai, where a suspected case has been reported, says his hospital is preparing staff to deal with a possible pneumonia outbreak. China’s National Health Commission reiterated that the outbreak was “preventable and controllable”, despite the fact that that the source of the virus has yet to be found and its path has yet to be fully mapped.
Three airports in major U.S. hubs will begin screening passengers arriving from Wuhan in response to the outbreak. The screening will start at airports in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced. Medical personnel will begin taking temperatures and asking about symptoms of passengers who travelled from the city. The illness was first reported in December. Fears of a more widespread outbreak arose last week when two cases were found in Thailand and one in Japan, carrying the same virus. At least a half-dozen countries in Asia, including Thailand and Japan, have started screening incoming airline passengers from central China.
Over the next few weeks, some 5,000 passengers are likely to be screened in the U.S., said Dr Martin Cetron, Director of CDC ’s Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. The chance for an epidemic in the US is deemed low, the officer at the CDC said, and the agency’s response is preventive. The CDC is deploying about 100 experts to the three airports. Roughly 60,000 to 65,000 people a year travel from Wuhan to the U.S. New York and San Francisco are the only two cities that have direct flights from Wuhan. Those passengers arriving in Los Angeles are on connecting flights.
More than 40 cases of the newly identified coronavirus have been confirmed in Asia, including two deaths – at least one involving a previous medical condition. Most of the patients are believed to have contracted the virus from exposure to animals to a specific seafood and meat market in Wuhan, but it is no increasingly likely that the disease can also spread from person to person. Chinese authorities said that no illnesses were reported among several hundred health care workers caring for the patients, but a recent case in China was a patient who did not go to the markets,

176,Corona Kluger,"Pandemics are perversely democratic things. They are nasty things, lethal things, yes, but give them this, they don’t discriminate. No matter your age, race, gender, region—no matter your very species in some cases—you’re probably a part of the pathogenic constituency. It’s a global kind of kumbaya—even if it’s the kind that can kill you.
That human collectivism—a universal response to a universal threat—is newly and powerfully evident in the face of the now-global outbreak of coronavirus. As of February 1, there have been 250 deaths, nearly 12,000 diagnosed cases, and a virus that emerged in a single city in China—Wuhan—indeed, in a single crowded market in that single city, has now spread world wide, with cases in TK NUMBER of countries across the Pacific rim as well as in Europe, the Middle east and the U.S.
“During an outbreak, it takes only a few links to make the global population fully connected,” says Justin lessler, associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “The last time a population was fully isolated was in the 15th century when the Spaniards came to the Americas and brought smallpox with them.”
Half a millennium on, the behavior of viruses hasn’t changed, but the behavior of their human hosts and victims has. If the response to new corona outbreak is showing anything, it’s that in an era of nativism, nationalism and a seeming breakdown of civility itself, we are actually getting better and better, smarter and smarter—and even kinder and kinder—at joining hands to battle a bug that threatens us all.
If there’s one thing that that gives the current coronavirus an edge that pandemics of earlier eras didn’t, it’s our new and growing state of human interconnectedness—with global air travel a force multiplier.",REAL

Health Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the reagent, a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis, was developed by IMR’s Virology Unit.
He said in the beginning, the IMR was the Health Ministry’s sole laboratory that was directly involved in conducting 2019-nCoV diagnostic tests.
“This unit has been on standby since Jan 3 to face potential spread of the 2019-nCoV in Malaysia, where the reagents were used to detect coronavirus using the Conventional RT-PCR method.
“On Jan 11, scientists from China shared 2019-nCoV genetic information on the virus, which enabled officers from the IMR Virology unit to develop a series of reagents named ‘primers and probes specific for 2019-nCoV’ on the same day.
“Several days later, WHO released its own protocol for real-time RT-PCR 2019-nCoV tests, and this protocol was almost similar to the one being used at the IMR,” he said in a statement today.
Dr Noor Hisham said the reagent to identify the 2019-nCoV virus arrived at IMR’s lab on Jan 21.
The following day, officers from IMR successfully conducted real time RT-PCR 2019-nCoV optimisation tests and was then handed to the National Public Health Laboratory at Sungai Buloh Hospital on Jan 24 to test the contact sample from Johor, he said.
The IMR, he added, also conducted training for real time RT-PCR tests at 12 hospitals and health labs in Ipoh, Kota Kinabalu, Kota Baru and Johor Baru.
“Every day, including on public holidays, on call staff will be ready to receive samples from hospital as early as 7am and will conduct tests and ensure results are out within 24 hours.
“Most of the time they have managed to provide us with the results well ahead of 24 hours.”
Dr Noor Hisham said only staff who had completed a competency test and were trained to properly wear Personal Protective Equipment were allowed to conduct the tests.
Meanwhile, the Health Ministry had also denied rumours circulating via Whatsapp that there were 2019-nCoV cases in Mid Valley Megamall and Sunway Hospital Cheras.

660,CDC Expedites Request Process Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) Cooperative Agreement Funds during 2019-nCoV Response,"CDC has reduced the normal 30-day request process to one to three business days for urgent requests.
The Division of State and Local Readiness (DSLR) has partnered with CDC’s Office of Grants Services (OGS) to develop a fast-track approval method that enables jurisdictions to request the use of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) cooperative agreement funds for the rapid procurement of services, supplies, and equipment needed during the current 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) emergency response.
As outlined in the 2019-2024 PHEP notice of funding opportunity (NOFO), PHEP cooperative agreement funding is intended primarily to support preparedness activities that help ensure state and local public health departments are prepared to prevent, detect, respond to, mitigate, and recover from a variety of public health threats. However, upon written request by a recipient, PHEP funds may, on a limited, case-by-case basis, be used to support response efforts if the activities fall within those authorized by the PHEP’s statutory authority, Section 319C-1 of the Public Health Service Act, the PHEP NOFO, and the terms and conditions of the PHEP notice of award. The activities also must support progress toward achieving CDC’s 15 public health preparedness and response capabilities and demonstrating related operational readiness.
Use of PHEP funds during an emergency response must be for activities within the approved scope of work in the PHEP recipient’s work plans for the current budget period. However, it is not uncommon that emergency response activities may constitute a change in scope, as they are not part of previously approved recipient work plans or subsequent budget redirections.
If recipients propose to use PHEP funds for response activities that are outside the approved scope of work, then recipients must identify this change in their request so that they can obtain specific prior approval from CDC to undertake these change-in-scope activities. Based on the request, the approval process may include both a budget redirection and a change in the scope of activities.
Prior approval by the CDC grants management officer (GMO) is required for a change in scope under any award, regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision. Expedited Process to Request Use of PHEP Funds for Response
Recipients must send an e-mail to both the CDC OGS grants management officer (GMO) and the assigned PHEP specialist with the following required information: Justification for use of funds and how the recipient plans to conduct various tasks as part of a comprehensive work plan activity. If a change in scope is known or anticipated, a justification for the change in scope of the work plan. Estimated amount of funds to be redirected, if any. Which PHEP award the action is associated with (TP17-1701 No-cost Extension or TP19-1901). Budget category. If redirection is necessary, requests should indicate from which budget category funds will be redirected and to which category they will be redirected. Description of the activities, such as the exercise goals and objectives, identified capabilities to be tested, or inclusion of at-risk individuals. For example: A statement on how the use of PHEP funds in this event will enable the testing of emergency plans and protocols. A description of how activities to be performed will be consistent with CDC guidance for mitigating risk to at-risk individuals. Statement confirming that results of the exercise or incident will be documented in a formal after-action report (AAR) and improvement plan (IP) and submitted to CDC. Statement demonstrating how a delay in approval or disapproval of the request would result in serious injury to citizens or financial or other adverse public impact.
Following the PHEP specialist’s review of the request, OGS will issue its final determination within one to three business days and email the recipient to let the jurisdiction know whether CDC has approved the request to use PHEP funds for emergency response activities. If the request is approved, the email will serve as the recipient’s authorization to use funds.
OGS will upload the authorizing email into GrantSolutions. The recipient must submit a revised budget and a revised work plan within 30 days from the date of the OGS email authorizing the use of PHEP funds for emergency response activities.",REAL

820,Baby Aged 30-Months Diagnosed of Corona Virus,"Two Cases Of Lassa Fever Confirmed In Katsina State
The baby’s mother tested positive before she gave birth. It is unclear how the disease was transmitted – in the womb, or after birth.
Only a handful of children have come down with the virus, which has killed 565 people and infected 28,018.
All but one of the deaths were in China.
State media outlet Xinhua reported news of the infection late on Wednesday.
It added that the baby, who weighed 3.25kg at birth (7lbs 2oz), was now in a stable condition and under observation.
Medical experts say it could be a case where the infection was contracted in the womb.
“This reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission,” chief physician of Wuhan Children Hospital’s neonatal medicine department, Zeng Lingkong, told Reuters.
But it is also possible that the baby was infected after birth from having close contact with the mother.
“It’s quite possible that the baby picked it up very conventionally – by inhaling virus droplets that came from the mother coughing,” Stephen Morse, an epidemiologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, told Business Insider.
Very few children have tested positive in this recent outbreak, which is consistent with other coronavirus outbreaks in recent history including Sars and Mers.
A report by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) said the median age of patients for the current outbreak is between 49 and 56 years, adding that cases in children “have been rare”.
Similarly, during the Mers outbreak in 2016, the World Journal of Clinical Paediatrics said the virus was rare in children, though it added that the “reason for [this] low prevalence is not known”.

According to some estimates , there to be around 58,000 cumulative cases in mainland China by the end of January (as of January 31, the reported cases are close to 12,000). The disease situation changes so rapidly, these numbers are outdated. The total case number today is closer to 30,000 with close to 600 deaths. Any discrepancy in the numbers is likely due to reporting delays. Also, the majority of the cases may be mild (or asymptomatic), do not require seeking medical care, and thus are not reported. The good news is that the death rate did not increase and remains at about 2 %.
Following the above reasoning, it should be expected that there are (and have been) already many cases in other countries, but these may be ""indeterminate"" and hopefully mild or asymptomatic. Could many cases have been previously diagnosed as ""common"" influenza, or another viral pneumonia, for instance. This is a complex issue, indeed.

Russia has closed its land border with China and suspended most train traffic between the countries. 
 One patient jumped out of a hospital window to escape her quarantine and another managed to break out by disabling an electronic lock.
Two Russian women who were kept in isolation for possible inflection by a new virus say they fled from their hospitals this month because of uncooperative doctors, poor conditions and fear they would become infected. Russian health authorities haven’t commented on their complaints.
The incidents occurred amid the outbreak of the virus in China that has already infected more than 40,000 people worldwide. In Russia, only two cases of COVID-19 have been reported. Nevertheless, the authorities took vast measures to prevent the new disease from spreading and hospitalized hundreds of people who returned from China as a precaution.
Many of those quarantined in different Russian hospitals complained about dire conditions of isolation rooms and lack of cooperation from doctors, uncertain about quarantine protocols.
Both women said their hospital ordeals began after returning from Hainan, a tropical region of China popular with Russian tourists.
In a lengthy account on Instagram published Friday, a woman with the screen name of GuzelNeder said her son came down with a cough and a fever of 37.3 C (99.2 F) four days after the family’s return to their home in the city of Samara. She called emergency services, who diagnosed the boy as having a viral respiratory infection and who said the mother and the son must go to a hospital for coronavirus tests.
The hospital promised test results within three days, then extended it to five, she said, and meanwhile the boy responded to treatment with medication and an inhalator, she wrote. When she tried to press for results, hospital personnel obstructed her, she said.
Meanwhile, she had become concerned about lax procedures in the hospital, saying that some medical personnel came to the isolation area without masks or threw their protective clothing on the floor.
Her anxiety soared on the fifth day, when she began to feel badly. She asked her husband to bring her a home pregnancy test, and “after two minutes of wringing my hands in anticipation, it came on the screen — PREGNANT,” she wrote.
Her husband argued with the doctor that she and their son should be released because of her condition and concern of infection. The doctor said they had to be held for 14 days even if the virus test came back negative.
“My son was hysterical,” she wrote. “There was no exit for us other than to leave the hospital without authorization, through the window,” Guzel said.
Police later questioned her at home, but no charges have been reported. “Everyone in my family is alive and healthy, thank god,” she wrote.
The other woman, Alla Ilyina, said in an Instagram post she came down with a sore throat several days after returning to St. Petersburg, Russia’s second largest city, from Hainan.
Ilyina called emergency services, and medics brought her to a hospital for coronavirus testing, promising to let her go after 24 hours. The next day she was told she tested negative for the virus, but had to remain quarantined for two weeks.
“Wild,” Ilyina wrote. “All three tests showed I was completely healthy, so why the hell the quarantine?”
Her isolation room was dire, she told the Fontanka newspaper — no books, no shampoo, no Wi-Fi a wastebasket that was never emptied, the door secured by an electronic lock.
Frustrated, she figured out how to short-circuit the electronic lock and escaped from the hospital on Friday.
Neither the hospital nor police have followed up on her escape, which leads her to believe her health is OK.
“If I were sick, they would have swamped me with phone calls,” Fontanka quoted her as saying.
On Tuesday evening, Russian media reported that the hospital reported Ilyina’s escape to the police, and that a criminal investigation could be launched into the incident.
Both women offered no immediate comment to The Associated Press.
Quarantine protocols in relation to the outbreak vary throughout Russia. In some regions, health officials isolate Chinese nationals who have recently returned from China, and in others everyone who reports symptoms resembling those of the new virus are subject to a 14-day quarantine.
Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s public health watchdog, hasn’t responded to a request for comment on whether the women were allowed to leave the hospitals.
On Wednesday, the Fontanka newspaper published a video reportedly recorded by other patients quarantined in the same hospital Ilyina fled from. The footage shows two young women in what appears to be a patient room singing “I want to be like Alla (Ilyina)” and a handwritten note saying “Let us out of here, please.”
Irina Sidorova, another woman who returned from Hainan on the same flight with Ilyina and was quarantined in the same hospital, confirmed to The Associated Press that isolation rooms there were locked, and patients weren’t able to get out on their own.
Sidorova said in a phone interview she was hospitalized only a week after she returned to St. Petersburg. She reiterated Ilyina’s complaints about uncooperative doctors and said she wasn’t allowed to leave the hospital until Feb. 15, despite showing no symptoms and testing negative for the virus.",REAL
754,Infinitus donates 6 million yuan in cash and supplies to support prevention and treatment efforts in dealing with 2019-nCoV,"In the last few days, all attention in China is focused on the prevention and treatment of the pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Medical staff from both Wuhan and around the country, as well as people from all walks of life, are working together to win the battle against the epidemic.
Infinitus ( China ) Company Ltd., a purveyor of healthy products and solutions, set up a new coronavirus epidemic prevention and control group as soon as they heard the first news reports about the new disease and received guidance from the government authorities. The firm adjusted the production and operation in a timely manner, and also it implemented the measures as per the requirements and initiatives put in place by governments and responsible authorities at all levels.
After learning about the initiatives of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese calling for donations from members of Chinese communities worldwide, Infinitus donated 5 million yuan (approx. USD720,000 ) to the Overseas Chinese Charity Foundation of China through the Si Li Ji Ren Foundation as a special fund to combat 2019-nCoV. The donation was sent directly to the affected areas in and around Wuhan.
At the same time, in response to the urgent demand for various kinds of protective supplies at Nanfang Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Infinitus immediately communicated with the hospital and donated one million yuan (approx. USD144,000 ) in supplies, including hand sanitizers and air purifiers, to help prevent and control the epidemic in Guangdong province.

240,Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) is providing an update to local clinicians regarding the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. Yesterday afternoon, declared a global public health emergency over the 2019-nCoV which does raise concerns, but nothing has changed as far as local preparedness. To date there are no cases in Windsor and Essex County . In response to the significant amount of communication and misinformation that is circulating within the community, the WECHU has developed a dedicated landing page on our website, www.wechu.org/coronavirus , which contains credible, reliable, and up-to-date local information for residents and health care providers in Windsor and Essex County (WEC). Please refer to the “For Professionals” section of this page for important information including a link to the “Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCov) Guidance for Primary Care Providers in a Community Setting” recently developed by the Ministry of Health.
The risk of exposure to WEC residents, as well as all Canadians, remains low at this time. In the absence of a in our community, it’s important to remind patients that they are more likely to contract locally circulating respiratory bacteria or viruses other than 2019-nCoV. Since the outbreak began in December, a number of patients tested (not in WEC) have come back positive for influenza and not 2019-nCoV. The precautions used to protect against 2019-nCoV are the same as those used to protect against common respiratory illnesses, such as influenza. The flu vaccine remains available in our community and remains the best protection against influenza. There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV.
Based on the latest research, this is what we now know about the 2019-nCoV. The virus is capable of person-to-person transmission. Most people are recovering from the infection and those died are elderly people with other comorbidities. A single case of 2019-nCoV can generate between 2.0-3.5 cases, this is slightly less than the number of cases that the influenza virus will generate. The average incubation period for 2019-nCoV seems to be approximately 5 days but it could be as long as 11 days. The case definition is still using 14 days as the incubation period.
There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity and other features associated with 2019-nCoV and investigations are ongoing.
At this time, the WECHU is not recommending any additional precautions other than usual practices in response to any respiratory illness, which includes: Washing hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoiding close contact with people who are ill. Staying home when ill. Covering a cough or sneeze with tissue. Cleaning and disinfecting objects and surfaces that are frequently touched.
Health care providers play an important role in supporting the response to suspected cases of 2019-nCoV. It is recommended that clinicians should assess patients prior to notifying public health or referring them to an acute care center for testing. If a patient presents with respiratory symptoms, the patient should be provided a surgical mask, isolated and assessed to see if they meet the case definition for the 2019-nCoV. The case definition at this time is as follows: Anyone with respiratory symptoms and a 14 day travel history to Wuhan, China, or Hubei province in China , OR Anyone with respiratory symptoms who has been in close contact with someone who travelled to Wuhan/Hubei province.
For and other clinical resources, please visit our website www.wechu.org/coronavirus .
The new coronavirus is considered a disease of public health significance and all suspected or confirmed cases of the 2019-nCoV must be reported to the WECHU. If a client meets the above case definition, please contact the WECHU at 519-258-2146, ext. 1420 for guidance and support as testing submission. For after-hours support (outside of 8:30am -4:30pm) please contact 519-973-4510.
While the risks posed by this new coronavirus to WEC residents remain low, the WECHU worldwide and, in collaboration with all of our health care partners, is working to be fully prepared to respond as needed.",REAL
811,"Coronavirus Has Nothing To Do With Corona Beer, But Some People In Colorado Think It Does","Some people apparently think that the coronavirus sweeping the globe is somehow related to Corona beer. Google searches for the terms “Corona beer virus” and “beer virus” have spiked over the past week, according to Google Trends .
And associating the virus and the beer apparently is a big thing in Colorado . Our state ranks #5 nationally in searches for “Corona beer virus.”
Worldwide, searches for this grouping of words is up more than 2300%.
Although there is a lot to be learned about this new strain of virus, it is known that it has NOTHING TO DO with Corona beer. There is simply NO link between the two. 
A source of confusion: the names.
The pale Mexican lager gets its name for the “crown” in Spanish.
The coronavirus gets its name from what the virus looks like under a microscope — viral particles that are round with a series of crown-like spikes protruding from it.
From a business perspective, the manufacturer has not commented, and sales of Corona have not dropped.
From a health perspective, once again, there’s nothing linking the beer and the virus.
As with many things, there are a number of falsehoods floating the internet about the virus, including this one.
One out there that’s more dangerous is the idea that drinking bleach will protect you from the virus. In this case, the virus won’t kill you, but drinking bleach will.
Don’t believe everything on the Internet.

600,The Corona Viruses.,"Corona virus is one of viruses that causes common cold ‘catarrh’ and other respiratory tract infections.
In November 2002 a Novel Corona virus outbreak occurred in Guangdong Province of Southern China. The SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) epidemics occurred worldwide.
8422 cases of SARS-CoV were identified by WHO in 26 countries, 90% of cases identified occurred in China and Hongkong. SARS Corona Virus now only exist in some advance Laboratories as a Bio-weapon of mass destruction or as a study samples for development of vaccines which is not yet available.
In September 2012 another Novel Corona Virus was identified as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-CoV). As at November 2019 , 2494 cases from 27 countries were Notified to WHO including 858 associated deaths globally [case fatality rate: 34.4%]. It was first identified in Saudi Arabia with 2102 including 780 related deaths.
The MERS vaccine and therapeutics is on the process as phase 2b/phase 3 clinical trials was conducted as of Feb. 2019. MERS is zoonotic disease identified in dromedary camels of Arabian peninsula and it is not easily transmitted via Human to Human transmission.
In 31st December 2019, WHO were alerted to several cases of Pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei province of China. 7th January 2020 Chinese Authorities announced a Novel Corona Viral infections that doesn’t matched any Known Virus tag “2019-nCoV”.
The 2019-nCoV epidemics is currently ongoing. As of today [29th January 2020] there are 6065 cases were confirmed including 135 associated deaths globally affecting China and other 15 countries.
So far, no any WHO reported cases in Africa or Nigeria. Airports and Seaports Authorities need to do more in careful Health screening of people from China specifically and other countries.
No available therapy or vaccine available for these Corona viruses. However Australian Scientists have claimed to recreate same Novel Corona Virus which is a step for development of therapy and vaccines.
As we currently battle with LASSA fever in Nigeria, it will be a double jeopardy if both LASSA and 2019-nCoV strikes at the same time.
Personal hygiene, constant handwashing and use of facial masks is effective preventive measures.",REAL

The first people are said to have become infected at a market in Wuhan, where it is believed that wild animals traded from there jumped onto people. China has taken drastic measures to combat further expansion: in Hubei province, more than 45 million people have largely been isolated from the outside world. Long-distance and local traffic has been stopped.

140,Are you afraid of Corona or of China? ,"It is impossible to avoid the Coronavirus panic. In recent weeks everyone wanted to talk about the plague and its consequences. The media was all obsessed about the numerical data of the disease, with most interviewers suggesting or even saying explicitly that the Chinese must be hiding or even lying about them. On one channel, I even got a proposition to do an article about the Chinese food habits and their contribution to the spread of the virus. The feeling is that the Chinese people are entitled to very little empathy for their situation, and the criticism and alienation towards them is unprecedented in relation to outbreaks of epidemics elsewhere in the past.
Is the denunciation justified? Tens of millions of Chinese are closed up in their homes, calculating how much food and equipment they have, just to keep their families out of the disease and prevent it from spreading. The Chinese government has sacrificed the country’s economy and has taken unseen measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The Chinese government even seems to be making great efforts to refute the assumption that information coming from China cannot be relied upon: official updates of current figures are regularly published, the World Health Organization has stated that the Chinese government is committed to preventing the epidemic and to cooperating with other countries on the issue and even US Vice President Mike Pence praised China for its transparency.
Just as a reference, on April 2009 the H1N1 (swine flu) virus was first detected in the US. According to CDC estimation up to 575,000 people died during the first year the virus was circulated. The numbers reported at the time were nowhere near that. No one raised the speculation that the US government was hiding numbers, the reasons to such underestimation can be numerous: shortage of manpower, real time diagnostical difficulties, overcrowded hospitals, and so on. The question now is why a nation that is going through such difficult time, its people acting courageously to survive it, is alienated and in fact, has to deal with the ricochets from outside as much as its own private war of survival.
Cognitive psychology has an explanation
The human tendency is to paint the world in black and white. Our brains like to think in the form of “either … or” because it makes it easier to process information. A person is either good or bad, a friend or foe. The most effective way to deal with complexity and ambiguity is to associate objects, events and people with categories.
An example of this is in Dr. David Eagleman’s study, which looked at the minds of subjects while watching a video showing six hands, each with the labeling of a certain group: atheists, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Muslims and Scientologists, while the needle randomly stabs one of the hands. The results were repeated over and over. When the subject watched a person from his group stabbed, there was a sharp increase in activity in the pain areas, but when the hand was associated with a person from an outside group, complete indifference to the pain was demonstrated.
That is, it seems that a single affiliation label is enough. Our brains are wired to categorize who belongs to the group and who is not and the more distanced we are from a group, for example a person from China versus a person from the West, the stronger the bias will be. Prejudice has emerged as a function of shared life in groups. Although life in the group promotes our survival, the fear of being harmed by someone external to the group has led to the development of a mechanism that allows identifying who belongs to the group and who is not. Over time, the rapid filtering process becomes automatic and unconscious. Therefore, even people who care about social equality show hidden negative tendencies towards other groups.
When we hear about a new virus coming from China, it is much easier to speculate, and believe speculations, that correspond with our labeling. Life is easier and clearer when the world is still organized in the way we expected it to be. However, in order to make the right decision, it is important to go deeper and determine which of our basic assumptions is fact-based and knowledgeable, and which are the result of biases that are not necessarily relevant or correct. The people of China are going through a difficult time, and act with great courage to survive it together, don’t turn your backs on them now.",REAL

While the withdrawal of other well-known companies will affect the world's largest smartphone trade fair (especially with 5G, which should be a big topic this year), the group responsible for MWC – the GSMA – says, the show would continue although it had introduced some new rules to ensure the health and safety of potential participants. These new regulations include the ban on people from Hubei, the province in China from which the corona virus originates, and proof that travelers have been outside China at least 14 days before MWC. [19659005] The GSMA will also install body temperature scanners and provide additional on-site medical support and disinfection stations throughout the venue. Although the loss of Amazon is sure to have a noticeable impact, Sony and TCL's plans to withdraw from MWC may not be entirely fatal as both companies continue to plan to unveil new devices at the show. The most important change is that Sony and TCL canceled their press conferences in Barcelona to reduce the risk of virus transmission to employees or participants. Sony has chosen to stream the announcement on Xperia's YouTube channel instead. As someone who is currently traveling to Barcelona for MWC 2020, it will be interesting to see whether other large companies are canceling their plans or what the impact of banning a large number of Chinese companies and employees could be.

544,Danger? Corona Virus And You,"The developments are startling. Over the last week, the official number of coronavirus 2019-nCoV cases has doubled every day , and yesterday the WHO declared this a Global Health Emergency . While most cases (10,000+) are confined to China, the early death rate stands at 2-4 percent and as of today, 27 nations are reporting infections.
What danger does coronavirus actually pose to you ? Perspective is important. Consider another viral infection with many similarities: influenza. Since October 2019, some 15 million Americans have become infected and greater than 8,500 have perished. At the moment, the risk of dying from a lightning strike (1 in 161,856) is greater than dying from coronavirus. However, this new infection has serious potential to become a worldwide calamity, parallel to the Spanish Influenza Epidemic of 1918.
How can you protect yourself from coronavirus infection? This is a disease spread via respiratory droplets. So, everything we know about the common cold also applies to prevention of coronavirus, especially hand washing, avoiding contact with ill person, staying home if ill, and reporting to a healthcare facility if no improvement. Let us not take such simple measure to mean today’s Global Health Emergency is unwarranted. In our international airline world, a pandemic could emerge within just days.",REAL

Russia has a 4,300km (2,670-mile) land border with China and has reported two cases of the flu-like virus far from the capital Moscow in Siberia, both involving Chinese nationals.
Deputy health minister Sergei Krayevoy said it was hard to predict how Russia’s 147 million people – including the disputed region of Crimea – would be affected by the fast-spreading virus which still has no vaccine.
But “we are preparing ourselves for a possible widespread of the infection,” he added in comments on Interfax news agency.
The virus has killed more than 420 people and infected more than 20,000, nearly all inside China, although cases have been recorded in 23 other countries and regions, and there have been two deaths in Hong Kong and the Philippines.
Moscow has restricted border crossings from China, suspended direct passenger trains and flights there, may deport foreigners who test positive and has sent the first plane to evacuate citizens from the virus epicentre Wuhan.
At least two regions – Ulyanovsk and nearby Samara region on the Volga River some 900km (560 miles) east of Moscow – have closed schools until the end of this week amid increased cases of flu which officials said were not linked to coronavirus.

DOH-CAR only monitored an individual who arrived from Guangzhou, China on January 19, 2020. The Chinese national has no any history of travel to Wuhan, China and without any known contact with a confirmed 2019-nCoV case, Severe Acute Respiratory Illness case, or sick animals.
For precautionary measures, the Chinese national and his two roommates were placed under self quarantine in their dormitory in La Trinidad, Benguet. They have no signs or symptoms of respiratory illness or any other disease as reported by health workers assigned to monitor them.
Pangilinan said the DOH-CAR already sent throat samples from individuals in quarantine to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for testing.
To prevent the entry of the 2019-nCoV in the Cordillera and elsewhere, the public is enjoined to practice preventive measures to help mitigate spread of respiratory infections.
The DOH issued the acronym WUHAN for Wash your hands regularly, Use facemask if necessary, Have your temperature checked regularly, Avoid crowded places and Never touch your eyes nose and mouth with dirty hands,which should be followed to ensure cleanliness and being healthy.
Corona viruses are a large family of viruses ranging from the common cold to more serious infections caused by MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Common signs of corona virus infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
According to the World Health Organization, the 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through human-to-human transmission. This can be facilitated through coughing, sneezing, and handling infected respiratory secretions which could be aggravated during mass gathering and festivities.
DOH encourages all health workers to be vigilant and take extra precautionary measures when in contact with patients with acute respiratory infection, especially those with travel history to Wuhan, China.
Further, all health facilities are encouraged to activate their Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases fast lanes, ensure availability of isolation rooms, and re-activate their referral system as part of their preparedness and response.
An intensified Influenza-like-illness surveillance is also encouraged to be observed by all health facilities.

He was a key member of the research team at the University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He’s been studying coronaviruses for 25 years (full bio here). The recording of the call can be found on our website HERE. Below are my notes transcribing the call. The first 30m is worth listening to. Quick summary: look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold that kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands. My notes from the call below: Q&A Session with Professor Nicholls: What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official “confirmed” cases? People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is <1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons 1) either china’s healthcare isn’t as good – that’s probably not the case 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARSthere’s probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There’s a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to Sars and Mers we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to Sars to Mers. So a correct comparison is not Sars or Mers but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold. You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that? There are two ways to detect a virus. 1) Through the genetic material – DNA or RNA or 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors’ lab look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests, they are using PCR which gives you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there’s another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can’t turnaround in 5-10m which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases. Your colleague at HK university estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb mid, we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past? Those figures did not take into account restrictions on travel, quarantine, etc… These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically these models have not been all that accurate. When do you think this thing will peak? Three things the virus does not like 1) sunlight 2) temperature and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit. Sunlight will cut the virus's ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 minutes and in the dark, it’s about 13m to 20m. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That’s why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infection rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing are still cold which is why there are high infection rates. In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And High humidity the virus doesn’t like it either. That’s why I think Sars stopped around May and June in 2003 – that’s when there are more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavorable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold – it’s always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favorable in Asia in about May. The second factor is that of personal contact. With Sars, once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal-oral route there was much less emphasis on the masks and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of social hygiene (than China). So in those countries, you should see fewer outbreaks and spread. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open- there’s more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries, the sanitation systems tend to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May. People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it’s all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality, this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials – is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say “I told you so”. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn’t come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It’s Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus – the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people, etc… What do we know about the transmission rate? It’s been estimated at around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic? This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don’t have with this virus). We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to Camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages of the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers. Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the Ro of 2.5 or 2.7. Do you think that is high or low? What does that mean? Measles were about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it’s about 2.2 as it’s being transmitted within the community. Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with Sars and Mers. There’s talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don’t think there are any super spreaders. What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic? Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That’s based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days. There’s a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shedding the virus and he was asymptomatic. That’s something about kids and we saw this with Sars. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus that we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer. SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn’t the virus killing the patients it was the body’s reaction. We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer. Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms of mortality rate? SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity – try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc... The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it’s those with co-morbidity are most at risk. For seasonal influenza that’s also what we find. It’s the people with the co-morbidity that have the increased mortality rate. Having said that there’s a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30. I think this looks more like seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity. Now that we have better case-control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%. When you look at all the death reports – separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China. The mortality rate in China – is much higher? Why? It's related to the environment. In high-income countries, you don’t have as high a population density, higher level of environmental control and hygiene. In Indonesia – it’s unlikely to spread much as it’s very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that’s unlikely – too hot there’s not a lot of travel there.. Europe – possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher. At this stage it’s a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the “lethal virus” but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don’t call that “lethal influenza” There’s news reports that antivirals are being used and that it’s working what are your thoughts on that? With SARS it didn’t seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seem to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it. Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit. The problem with the antivirals – because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so we can now test it to see what will work and not work. Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything? What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals – it’s to take the workload off the staff which is likely exhausted. In HK with SARS, we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the workload off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit. The recovery rate now higher than the death rate? Thoughts on that? What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn’t know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China, they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don’t get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge. I’d consider a patient recovered if he’s been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid was very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn’t know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression. I haven’t seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged. Evidence of E-coli? Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK. What does it mean for a patient to have recovered? That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That’s the criteria for Hong Kong. But there’s no good data or guidelines on this. What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population? If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don’t have a ”spell check” so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won’t mutate. This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months. Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. With SARS we didn’t know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages, people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn’t be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workloads off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan. If we look at the serious cases being reported it’s about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption? In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that’s why it’s important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It’s very important to dissect it out. Would it be too early to make a conclusion outside of Wuhan? It’s still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making an assumption with very little data and very early data? That’s all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages – there’s such a variable. But now for a political reason, people are far more aware of the virus so it won’t be as epidemic as it was early on. There are far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behavior. Which I’m not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far. Bloomberg also has detailed a story on China buying out a patent on Gilead drug for CoNv which still under trial. The Gilead drug is being rushed into human trials - no guarantees In any case, the situation was never raised to the pandemic level. Broadly it is emerging it's over on Corona faster than SARS.

716,Dgte mayor calls for vigilance vs 2019-nCoV,"In view of confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the country, Dumaguete City Mayor Felipe Antonio Remollo urged residents here not to panic but to be vigilant and exercise precautionary measures by keeping a clean environment.
The first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus infection or the 2019-nCoV is that of a female Chinese tourist who visited the city.
In a press conference, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III confirmed that a Chinese female patient under hospital care due to the 2019-nCoV is recuperating in an undisclosed Manila hospital.
However, calls mount for the banning of entry of all tourists coming from China.
""While we have concerns on the entry of tourists and guests, the city and province have no control of the airports and seaports. The national government is doing their best to contain the virus and we in the local level are in close coordination with the national agencies to keep our citizens safe from this rare virus,"" Remollo stressed.
City Health Officer Dr. Maria Sarah Talla reiterated the tips to avoid risk of coronavirus infection: observe proper hand washing, cover nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing with tissue or flexed elbow, thoroughly cook meat and eggs, avoid crowded areas, get plenty of rest, drink fluids, eat a balanced diet and avoid smoking.
Experts claim that coronavirus is transmitted by contact with an infected person and not through the air one breathes.
Remollo has earlier activated the Barangay Health Emergency Reaction Teams (BERT) to monitor and report residents who are suspected to be possible carriers of the virus.
According to Talla, local and health officials are on heightened alert and conducted surveillance on ""emergency or out-patient department cases with focus on those with recent history of travel to and from the City of Wuhan Hubei Province of China,"" which has since been quarantined.
Talla said BERTS and other health workers will focus on monitoring those cases or persons with recent history of travel to and from the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in the 14 days prior to symptom onset.
The City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council convened on Friday and agreed to enhance the information education drive about the 2019-nCoV and combat fake news by deploying health workers and disaster management officials in the barangays so that people could fully understand the means on how to protect themselves.
Talla also gave updates and instructions to health workers from the barangays and schools to enhance the Information Education Campaign to minimize risk of coronavirus infection in the communities.
Concerned agencies of the city government will coordinate with the Department of Health and the newly-instituted Hospital Command System led by Assistant Provincial Health Dr. Liland Estacion to maximize efforts to monitor, quarantine, and treat suspects of the 2019-nCoV.

573,LaTribuna Christian Publishing Reports on How to Protect Ourselves and Our Loved Ones from The Corona-Virus,"Chaplain Paul Vescio has served as a Community Chaplain in healthcare for over ten years now and has written an e-book entitled How To Protect Our Families in American Health Care.
Chaplain Paul Vescio CEO of LaTribuna Christian Publishing is quoted saying, The flu and the Corona-Virus is yet another wake up call in a long string of very harmful viruses. The question is, how to better protect our selves and our loved ones from possible infection? The answer or I should say part of the solution is in washing hands often, The CDC recommends washing hands often in order to reduce the risk of infection. Think about how many things we touch in a single day. The gas pump and the credit card machines, the elevator buttons, all of the buttons at the self checkout at the grocery store. The grocery cart, door handles, faucets, our cell phones, computer keys, handles, money, we touch and handle things in the store all the time. The list goes on and on and we don’t even think about the fact that infection is easily spread this way.
Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, If you or someone in your family is dealing with the flu then it wouldn’t hurt to have that person wear a surgical mask and gloves. This helps to reduce the spread of infection in hospitals. If you or some one in your family works in a nursing home or hospital setting then have them remove their shoes when they return home. Use bleach wipes to disinfect shoes. Wipe down all can goods, bottles and containers before bringing them into your home.
Chaplain Paul was also quoted saying, wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands often, as a Community Chaplain I see all to often how easy infection spreads in a hospital setting. Remember try not to cough or sneeze into your hands, stay home if you are sick. Do not visit anyone in a hospital or nursing home setting if you are sick or even have a cold. Above all pray for God’s guidance, protection and love in these matters and remember what proverbs 3:5-6 teaches, Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your paths…Amen”
LaTribuna Christian Publishing supports educating the public on how infection spreads and how we as a nation can best prevent the spreading of infection.",REAL

148,Ministry of Health advises the public on newly discovered novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of this infection include:  regular proper hand washing,  covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing,  thoroughly cooking meat and eggs and  avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.
The international medical community, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the regional Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) are concerned that this new virus can result in a pandemic (a worldwide occurrence of the virus) as occurred with SARS and H1N1 avian influenza. Should the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) become more efficient at human-to-human transmission, the threat of a pandemic will increase dramatically. The global nature of travel and trade could increase the likelihood of the risk of rapid transmission around the world in a very short period of time. Based on currently available information, however, WHO does not recommend any restriction of travel or trade. Today, at the conclusion of the first meeting of theInternational Health Regulations Emergency Committee the decision for declaration as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was deferred until a second meeting scheduled for tomorrow. At this time, it is expected that additional information from WHO experts on the ground in China would be considered.
Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the International Health Regulations (2005). Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health will continue to utilize the established interim guidelines published by the WHO on how countries can prepare for this virus. This includes how to monitor for sick people; test samples; treat patients; control infection in health centres; maintain the right supplies; and communicate with the public about this novel coronavirus. The Ministry will continue to build on its existing national plans, which were implemented to address viruses, such as, SARS and Influenza H1N1 which occurred in a similar fashion. Our aim as always, is to limit the effect on the population and prevent social disruption as much as possible.",REAL
868,CDC Recommends Nasopharyngeal Swabs AND Oropharyngeal Swabs as Suitable for Upper Respiratory Tract Specimens for Investigations of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ,"On January 30 th , 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) held its second meeting in Geneva of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). During the meeting the committee agreed that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and that the PHEIC "" should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China , its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success i ."" A coordinated global effort is critical in order to improve worldwide preparedness and successful measures to contain this outbreak in other regions of the world.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have released an Interim Guidelines for Collecting, Handling, and Testing Clinical Specimens from Patients Under Investigation (PUIs) for 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) recommending ""[c]ollection of three specimen types, lower respiratory, upper respiratory and serum specimens for testing"" from patients under investigation (PUI) of the novel coronavirus ii .
For upper respiratory specimens, the CDC is recommending nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates, nasal aspirates or to collect both a nasopharyngeal swab AND an oropharyngeal swab made of synthetic fiber with plastic applicators. Once the specimens are collected, it is recommended that the swabs are placed in 2-3 ml of viral transport media iii .
One of COPAN's kits pairs 3mL of UTM® universal viral transport medium and two FLOQSwabs™: one minitip synthetic flocked swab ideal for nasopharyngeal samples and one regular synthetic flocked swab ideal of oropharyngeal samples. COPAN manufactures private label UTM® for Becton Dickinson (as UVT), Diagnostic Hybrids-Quidel, and Hardy Diagnostics (as Healthlink UTM®).
The open structure of COPAN FLOQSwabs™ acts like a soft brush that efficiently dislodges and collects cells and mucus, then releases the sample immediately when immersed in viral transport medium. COPAN flocked swabs are easy to use and less invasive causing minimal discomfort for the patient when compared to nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates or nasal washes.

Here’s a look at what you need to know about the new virus.
A newly identified coronavirus called 2019-nCoV has been spreading in China, and has now reached several other countries. Here’s a look at what you need to know.
Update on Monday, Jan. 27 (ET):
See below for up-to-date information on everything you need to know about the spreading coronavirus. What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most people get infected with coronaviruses at one point in their lives, but symptoms are typically mild to moderate. In some cases, the viruses can cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia and bronchitis.
These viruses are common amongst animals worldwide, but only a handful of them are known to affect humans. Rarely, coronaviruses can evolve and spread from animals to humans. This is what happened with the coronaviruses known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov), both of which are known to cause more severe symptoms. How many people have the new virus?
As of Sunday, there are more than 2,700 confirmed cases and at least 80 deaths linked to the 2019-nCoV virus, according to The New York Times. Sunday evening, the CDC announced two more U.S. cases, one in Los Angeles County, California, and another in Maricopa County, Arizona. Early Saturday, the third person in the U.S., this one in Orange County, California, was reported to have tested positive for the new coronavirus; according to the county health department, the person had traveled from Wuhan and was in “good condition,” the Times reported. The second person in the United States (a woman in Chicago) was confirmed to have the virus on Jan. 24, and the first case was confirmed in a man in Washington state on Jan. 21. So far, all of of the infected individuals in the U.S. had also recently returned from Wuhan.
The first “presumptive” case of the novel virus has been reported in Canada in a man in his 50s who had returned from Wuhan to Toronto, the Times also reported. How far has the virus spread?
The first cases of the pneumonia-like virus were reported in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. Since then, the virus has spread to various other countries, including Thailand, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States, Australia, France, Taiwan, among others. On Saturday (Jan. 25), a “presumptive” case of the virus was reported in Toronto in a man in his 50s who had visited Wuhan, while Portugal’s health ministry says they are watching a patient in Lisbon for the virus; the person also had recently traveled to Wuhan, the Times said.
The first U.S. case was confirmed on Jan. 21 in a man in Washington state who had recently traveled to Wuhan. On Jan. 24, officials confirmed a second case in a woman from Chicago who had also recently traveled to the Chinese city. Both cases were hospitalized, but doing well, officials said. There are now five confirmed cases in the U.S.
The CDC is also investigating more than 60 people in 22 states for a possible infection with the new virus, officials said Friday (Jan. 24). Eleven of those people had tested negative for the virus. Where did the virus come from?
Since the virus first popped up in Wuhan in people who had visited a local seafood and animal market, officials could only say it likely hopped from an animal to humans. In a new study, however, researchers sequenced the genes of 2019-nCoV (as the virus is now called), and then they compared it with the genetic sequences of more than 200 coronaviruses that infect various animals around the world. Their results, detailed in the Journal of Medical Virology , suggested that 2019-nCoV likely originated in snakes .
As for what kind of snake, the scientists noted there are two snakes that are common to southeastern China where the outbreak originated: the many-banded krait ( Bungarus multicinctus ) and the Chinese cobra ( Naja atra ).
However, some experts have criticized the study, saying it’s unclear if coronaviruses can indeed infect snakes. How did the virus hop from animals to humans?
Some viruses are known to become capable of transmitting to humans, and this coronavirus is one of those. But how? The study published in the Journal of Medical Virology, revealing the likely snake host, also found that a change to one of the viral proteins in 2019-nCoV allows the virus to recognize and bind to receptors on certain host cells. This ability is a critical step to entering cells, and the researchers said that the change in this particular protein may have helped the virus hop to humans. Can the virus spread between people?
Yes, in limited cases, according to the CDC, but the primary mode of transmission seems to be from animal to human. In terms of how one would catch the virus, the CDC says that human coronaviruses are most commonly spread between an infected person and others via:
—the air (from viral particles from a cough or sneeze);
—close personal contact (touching or shaking hands);
—an object or surface with viral particles on it (then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands);
—and rarely from fecal contamination.
MERS and SARS have both been known to cause severe symptoms in people. It’s unclear how the new coronavirus will compare in severity, as it has caused severe symptoms and death in some patients while causing only mild illness in others, according to the CDC. All three of the coronaviruses can be transmitted between humans through close contact.
MERS, which was transmitted from touching infected camels or consuming their meat or milk, was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and has mostly been contained in the Arabian Peninsula, according to NPR. SARS was first reported in 2002 in southern China (no new cases have been reported since 2004) and is thought to have spread from bats that infected civets. The new coronavirus was likely transmitted from touching or eating an infected animal in Wuhan.
During the SARS outbreak, the virus killed about 1 in 10 people who were infected. The death rate from 2019-nCoV isn’t yet known, although most of the patients who have died from the infection have been older than 60 and have had preexisting conditions. However, more recently, a young healthy man died in Wuhan, raising concern that the virus might be more dangerous than thought, according to The Washington Post . What are the symptoms of the new coronavirus and how do you treat it? How would this virus cause a pandemic?
In order for this virus, or any, to lead to a pandemic in humans, it needs to do three things: efficiently infect humans, replicate in humans and then spread easily among humans, Live Science previously reported . Right now, the CDC is saying this virus passes between humans in a limited manner, but they are still investigating. How does the virus compare to SARS and MERS?
Symptoms of the new coronavirus include fever, cough and difficulty breathing. These symptoms are similar to those caused by SARS, according to a recent study published in the journal The Lancet.
Despite sharing some symptoms that were similar to SARS, there “are some important differences,” such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms like runny nose, sneezing and sore throat and intestinal symptoms like diarrhea, which affected 20% to 25% of SARS patients, lead author Bin Cao, from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and the Capital Medical University, both in Beijing, said in a statement.
There are no specific treatments for coronavirus infections and most people will recover on their own, according to the CDC. So treatment involves rest and medication to relieve symptoms. A humidifier or hot shower can help to relieve a sore throat and cough. If you are mildly sick, you should drink a lot of fluids and rest but if you are worried about your symptoms, you should see a healthcare provider, they wrote. (This is advice for all coronaviruses, not specifically aimed toward the new virus).
There is no vaccine for the new coronavirus but researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health confirmed they were in preliminary stages of developing one. In addition, the drug company Regeneron announced that it is in the early stages of developing a treatment for this virus, according to NBC News. What is being done to stop the spread of the coronavirus?
The Chinese government has stopped most of the travel to and from Wuhan as well as 12 other nearby cities, according to The New York Times . This “lockdown” affects about 35 million people, the Times reported. On Sunday, Taiwan’s government announced they would not allow in anyone from the Hubei Province, the Times reported. Also on Sunday, the Hong Kong government announced it would bar from entering the city residents of the Hubei Province or anyone who had visited the province in the past 14 days, the Times said.
Major airports in the U.S. are conducting screenings to make sure incoming passengers aren’t infected. However, U.S. officials said on Friday (Jan. 24) that they are currently reevaluating the effectiveness of this screening. In addition, as of Sunday (Jan. 26), the Chinese government had banned the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants and online.
“The Chinese government’s announcement today to temporarily ban the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants and over e-commerce needs to be permanent. We congratulate the government for taking this important first step,” Christian Walzer, chief global veterinarian at for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a WCS statement.
“The banning of such sales will help end the possibility of future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, such as the Wuhan coronavirus. We learned this lesson with the outbreak of another zoonotic disease, SARS, in 2002. The pattern will keep repeating itself until we ban, not only in China, but in other countries, the sale of wildlife, specifically for food and in food markets,” Walzer added.
The CDC also recommends avoiding non-essential travel to Wuhan. On Jan. 23, the U.S. State Department ordered all non-emergency U.S. personnel and family to leave Wuhan, the department said in a statement. What do we expect in the coming days?
Looking at what happened with MERS and SARS, it’s likely that some spread of the virus from close contact between humans will continue to occur, according to CDC. More cases — possibly including some in the U.S. — will likely be identified in the coming days.
In a statement released on Sunday, the CDC said: “It is likely there will be more cases reported in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks, likely including person-to-person spread. In previous outbreaks with MERS and SARS, the two other coronaviruses that have jumped the species barrier to cause severe illness in people, person-to-person spread has been seen, including among healthcare workers caring for patients ill with coronavirus infection.”
If traveling to Wuhan, you should avoid contact with sick people, avoid dead or alive animals, animal markets or products that come from animals such as uncooked meat, according to the CDC. You should often wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, they wrote. If you are infected by the virus you can take steps to help avoid transmitting it to others such as isolating yourself at home, separating yourself from other people in the house, wearing a face mask, covering your coughs and sneezes and washing your hands, according to the CDC.
People who traveled to Wuhan and became sick with fever, cough or difficulty breathing within the following two weeks should seek medical care right away, and call ahead to inform medical staff about their recent travel.",REAL
810,20 Practical Steps To Take For The Corona Virus Now,"As of right now the Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCOV) from Wuhan, China has not reached a critical situation here in the USA. However, it has become a very serious public health crisis in China and it is spreading quite quickly. So this situation bears some additional scrutiny. Before we get to far lets just get a few things out of the way about this virus. This is a new virus. It has not ever been seen before in humans. This strain of the Corona Virus is a zoonotic virus that is believed to have originated in either bats or snakes. Regardless of all of the fake news about it being previously patented we know for sure that it is in fact brand new. Additionally, there is currently no vaccine although the National Institute of Health is working on a vaccine and hopes to have it ready for human trials in about 3 months. This virus attaches itself to the Ribonucleic acid (RNA) Chain in the human body and this means that is is very capable of mutation. Every time this virus enters a new body and replicates itself it makes small errors in replication which lead to slightly different variations in the virus. These variations can be either good or bad. It may make the virus harder to kill or it may make it die off more easily. The main thing to know is that it is highly capable of mutation. This virus is spread through airborne water particles that are excreted when humans cough and sneeze, through close contact with someone who has the virus and through picking up the virus from surfaces (fomites) that are laden with the virus and then touching your mucus membranes with your infected fingers. It is believed that the virus may be able to live on surfaces for up to 5 days. The virus prefers a cold dry environment and does not live as long in hot and humid areas. It is currently believed that the incubation period before showing symptoms is anywhere from 2 to 14 days. That means that a person can have the virus and be contagious before they are showing symptoms. It is almost certain that they Chinese government is under reporting the numbers of seriously sick and dying so it is very difficult to gauge the actual infection rate, mortality rate and R0 factor. However, based on the response of the Chinese government and the fact that they have quarantined more than 60,000,000 people in 11 major cities; which has brought much of the Chinese economy to a stand still, it is safe to say that the Chinese government is very concerned about this disease. In the United States, there are on average about 30,000 deaths from influenza per year. The population of the USA is about 300 million,which means that 0.01% of our population dies each year from influenza. China has a population of about 1.3 billion. Multiply that by 0.01% and we can extrapolate that China has about 130,000 people every year die from influenza. Does China quarantine millions of people every year due to the flu? No, so it is safe to say that they are very certain that this virus is going to kill many more people than the typical flu. There are many reasons why this virus may not propagate with the same efficiency here in the USA. First, we don’t typically live with multiple generations of family in tight living quarters. Our access to good sanitation facilities and supplies is much better here. Also our social spacing is much further here in the US than in China. So it is not at all a certainty that this virus will get bad here in the USA, but it is possible that we could have at least some significant impacts from it.
So with that in mind here are some easy things you can start doing right now to reduce your chances of exposure to the virus should it start to get worse here in the USA. Pay attention and follow updates from credible sources. Not a time for panic. But we should be staying on top of developments. Both of the following links are good reliable places to learn more about this virus and get updates on the situation. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/index and https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 Cancel all international travel plans if possible. This virus has already spread to multiple countries and will only continue to get worse. As of today 30 Jan 2020, the US Government has issued a Level 4 Travel ban to China. Meaning that the State Department does not believe it is safe to go there. Commercial travel companies and airlines will likely start suspending all travel to and from China for the time being. Contact your state and federal representatives and ask them to push for closing all international flights into and out of the USA. Consider not going to any public gatherings with large numbers of people. Going out to eat, movies, sporting events, concerts, etc. Instead of going to the grocery store and walking through the store order your food online and pick it up. Instead of going to the gym, workout at home using body weight exercises, going for a jog or walk. Take your lunch to work instead of going out to eat. Or if you go out to eat go through the drive through instead of going inside to eat. Or call ahead and do curbside pick up if offered. At work talk to your boss about the possibility of an alternate work schedule or working from home, telecommuting, etc. Small children in day cares that are not yet in elementary school, consider keeping them at home or hiring a baby sitter to watch them at your home for a couple of weeks. Start family members and especially Elementary school age children and the elderly on immune boosting supplements, Zinc Lozenges, Elderberry Lozenges, Vitamins A, B, C, and E. Antioxidants, etc. Drink plenty of water and stay very hydrated and get plenty of sleep, at least 8 hours. Wash hands and face multiple times a day. Change your clothing as soon as you get home and shower twice a day once in the morning and once when you get home from work. Wash clothing in hot water as soon as possible. This goes for children too! Limit touching face with hands as much as possible. Use bleach or Lysol sanitation wipes or white vinegar to clean high traffic surfaces throughout your home often. Install a ultra fine air filter in your homes Central AC/Heater unit. This will just help to clean the air and will capture more dust and debris that could cause airway irritation. If you have to go into public places do what you can to increase your personal space (social distance) distance from 3 feet to a minimum of 6 feet but preferably 12 feet. Utilize hand sanitizer after touching items that have been in high traffic areas. The virus is believed to be able to live on surfaces for up to 5 days. If you start to feel sick, make sure you stay home from work and isolate your self from the public and your family as much as you can. There is no cure for this virus, but if the symptoms get serious and you have a fever, severe coughing and shortness of breath go to your medical provider. While I don’t think it is time to start wearing masks and goggles whenever you are in public it does seem prudent to go ahead and try to make sure you have some on hand just in case the situation gets worse. Home Depot and Lowes still had some when I checked our local store today. Amazon and Wal-mart.com were pretty much sold out. The ones at hardware stores are not medical grade, but they are N95 and are better than nothing for sure. If you decide to start wearing a mask in public don’t forget to wear goggles as well, because this virus can easily be caught through the mucus membranes in your eyes. As you guys know I am not an alarmist and I do not go around screaming that the sky is falling. But there are multiple factors about this pandemic that warrant your full attention. Will it get bad here in the USA? I am personally about 80/20. I think there is an 80% chance that it will not be any worse than a typical flu season. But I am also about 20% sure that it at least has the potential to be pretty bad. Perhaps something on par with the Spanish Flu (Swine Flu) of 1918 or worse. Lets just hope and pray that is not the case.

188,Report: Corona outbreak threatens Apple's iPhone shipments,"Reuters reported today, Wednesday, that Foxconn may witness a ""significant"" impact on production and the disruption in Apple's customer shipments if a Chinese factory stops due to a second week of corona virus outbreak.
The agency quoted an informed source that the Taiwanese company Foxconn - which makes smart phones for Apple and other brands - has suspended ""almost all production operations in China"" after the companies were asked to close until February 10, at least, and the source added This extended hiatus may disrupt shipments to customers, including Apple.
The source told Reuters on Monday that Foxconn has so far witnessed a ""somewhat slight impact"" of the outbreak, as it uses its factories located in countries such as Vietnam, India and Mexico to bridge the gap, adding that the company will be able to compensate for the delay if the factories were working overtime After the ban.
Companies in Suzhou, in eastern China, were asked to remain closed until at least February 8, and in Shanghai until February 9. The factories in the southern Dongguan Industrial Center in Guangdong Province, destined for export, will remain closed until February 10.
The outbreak of the Coruna virus - declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization - threatens to disrupt Chinese industrial space. The source said: The hiatus after February 10 might disrupt Foxconn shipments, highlighting concerns about production centers in southern Guangdong Province and Jingju City, Henan Province, where major iPhone factories are located.
Foxconn asked employees and customers in the Chinese province of Hubei - which is the epicenter of the disease - not to return to factories, and asked workers to report their health status to managers daily, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The company also said: that employees who follow the rules will get paid as usual, and that those who violate them will be punished ""severely."" The company launched a hotline to encourage employees to report violators of the rules, by giving them 200 yuan ($ 29).

377,"2019-nCoV, extremely dangerous type of coronavirus that spreads fast","Wuhan coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV is a new type of a virus, extremely dangerous and with an ability to spread fast. Virus from China There are almost 40 coronaviruses we are familiar with nCoV means Novel Coronavirus which means that it is new and its behavior is not yet totally understood. What we know is that it is a coronavirus. There are almost 40 coronaviruses we are familiar with and they all share similar characteristics. This is a family of viruses we can find in animals, from cattle to domestic animals like cats, and wild species like bats. Now, they usually stay among animal population but when the jump occurs, consequences are deadly. And that's exactly what happened to 2019-nCoV: an animal to person spread happened, and when the Wuhan coronavirus found its home in humans, a mutation occurred. The virus started to spread between people via air, which is scary by itself, but then it became worse: people without symptoms may spread the virus and that's an ideal situation for any virus. A silent spread is what every virus dreams of. Add to that 14 days period of incubation during which an infected person comes into a contact with other people and you have a very fast spread of a very nasty virus. Common human coronaviruses, that's something we all catch sooner or later, and several times in our lives. A common cold is a typical example of our close encounter with that type of viruses. Usually, they cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses. Symptoms are exactly what you could thought they are: cough, cough, runny nose, headache, fever. Human coronaviruses can spread lower to a lower-respiratory tract and cause well known bronchitis and pneumonia. So, what's so scared about Wuhan coronavirus? First, it's new. We know that it is more than 85 percent identical with a SARS virus but it's just similar, it in fact belongs to another lineage of the sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family. That means two problems. First, since it's new, we don't know exactly how to fight against it. Second, it's similarity to SARS is not good: SARS causes very serious symptoms and fatality rate is high. Patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection reported mild to severe symptoms: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Those symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Then comes the pneumonia which is severe and can lead to death. Second, another bad news is that although we know that 2019-nCoV spreads person to person but we don't know exactly how, the underlining mechanism is still not clearly known. That's the reason Wuhan coronavirus spreads so easily and fast, much faster than other known viruses. So, what to do? There is currently no vaccine against 2019-nCoV. The best way, as with other viruses, is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The best way is to wear a mask if you are in an infected region. Well, there are some problems here too. The first type of masks is a surgical masks you can buy anywhere. But, they don't prevent a person from inhaling smaller airborne particles and they are not officially recognized as a protection. And they are not airtight. Another type, N95 respirators, is something healthcare professionals use. They are tight fitting and filter out at least 95% of airborne particles. You can buy them too but you must be trained to fit them correctly. Thus, masks won't give you a 100% protection, they will just stop some number of particles to get in your system. In other words, better something than nothing. If you are in a contaminated area, or think you are, you should: - Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds - Avoid touching your head with unwashed hands - Avoid close contact with people who are sick - Stay home if you are sick - Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue - Clean frequently touched surfaces with disinfect If you think you were exposed to 2019-nCoV you should contact your doctor right away. Since there is no specific treatment for Wuhan coronavirus infection patients receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. In severe cases, treatment includes care to support vital organ functions. ",REAL

627,"2019 new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Wednesday, February 5, 202","The Panama Canal Authority is concerned with the recent outbreak of the 2019 new Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which has generated an International Maritime Health Association Advisory.
The signs and symptoms associated with the infection with this virus include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in more severe cases, it could lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
The average incubation period for the Coronavirus is approximately seven days, and infection from human-to-human may occur during the incubation period, before the infected person shows any signs of illness.
The following countries have reported confirmed cases of the virus: China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Germany, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, United States of America, France, and Australia.
It is imperative that vessels arriving at Panama Canal waters, for port calls or transit, after having called at ports located in any of these countries, or any other country with confirmed cases of the virus, and having identified any suspected case on board demonstrating any of the above-mentioned symptoms, report this condition through the Panama Maritime Single Window (VUMPA), within 30 days prior to their arrival. This is necessary in order to take appropriate measures to prevent the possible spread of this virus in the Republic of Panama.
Such measures include, but are not limited to, boarding the vessel by sanitary health authorities in order to investigate any cases; use of personal protective equipment, such as masks, by ACP personnel, or holding the vessel in quarantine as a precautionary measure.

Wednesday, February 5, 2020, Philippines
The Philippines’ Department of Health has issued a new circular giving guidelines at all seaports to prevent the spread of Novel Coronavirus Acute Respiratory Disease (2019-nCoV ARD).
The Bureau of Quarantine is implementing the following measures for all maritime vessels at all Philippine seaports:
CRUISE VESSELS
Cruise ships with passengers, regardless of nationality, from China, Macau and Hong Kong SAR or that have passed through in the past 14 days may not dock at any Philippine port. Cruise ships that have not called at or passed through ports in China, Macau and Hong Kong SAR within the past 14 days are allowed to dock in Philippine ports. However, they must undergo complete screening measures, submission of duly-accomplished Maritime Declaration of Health, and other pertinent documents related to 2019-nCoV ARD. Cruise ships allowed to dock must declare all travel itineraries/excursions in the Philippines. The master of the vessel must report immediately any occurrence of flu-like symptoms. If there are any cases of individuals on board suffering from flu-like symptoms, the master must report it immediately to the Quarantine Medical Officer (QMO) for guidance on implementing infection prevention and control protocols to minimise the spread of infection on board. The QMO will conduct triaging of cases. No Filipinos are allowed to embark any cruise ships going to China. CARGO VESSELS
All vessels calling from China, including Hong Kong and Macau SAR, in the past 14 days must be boarded at the quarantine anchorage. Upon arrival at the quarantine anchorage, the mast of the vessel must hoist at its foremast the yellow flag and immediately inform the Quarantine station at the assigned port through ship agents. Strictly no embarkation/disembarkation. Quarantine Boarding formalities shall ensue – the mater shall submit a duly accomplished Maritime Declaration of Health and the BOQ shall issue free pratique. Other boarding formalities shall commence. Vessels cleared at the first port of entry and calling at another local port, which within the past 14 days has travelled from China, Hong Kong and Macau SAR, must be boarded at the designated Quarantine anchorage area by the QMO, submit daily accomplished Maritime Declaration of Health and other pertinent documents. The master of the vessel must report immediately any occurrence of flu-like symptoms. If there are any cases of individuals on board suffering from flu-like symptoms, the master must report it immediately to the Quarantine Medical Officer (QMO) for guidance on implementing infection prevention and control protocols to minimise the spread of infection on board. The QMO will conduct triaging of cases. Ship agent of vessel with PUI situated in a non-competent port will arrange the immediate diversion of the vessel to the nearest competent port (Manila and Cebu) in the Philippines territory. PUI in a competent port will be conducted to a dedicated hospital and the vessel will be declared as affected vessel. A confirmed laboratory result of case will commence a 14-day quarantine at the anchorage and the hoisting of the Lima flag. Day zero starts at the conduction of the PUI. On the 14th day, the QMO will board the vessel, examine the documents, muster the crew and issue a free pratique. The master of the vessel may then lower the yellow flag and other formalities will commence. GENERAL PREVENTATIVE MEASURES
Continue hygienic practices and sanitary measures at all times. Waste disposal from vessels coming in from China, including Hong Kong and Macau SAR, in the past 14 days, are not allowed in Philippine ports.

South Africa’s National Ports Authority Transnet has issued instructions for the procedure for Health Risk Alert related to the Novel Coronavirus.
The following procedure has been developed to prevent the spread of any infectious diseases. The quarantine period will be confirmed by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) and Port Health based on their assessment: Prior to boarding a vessel, TNPA pilots are to contact Port Control and confirm Free Pratique has been received, and enquire about the past ten ports of call. TNPA Security also to check with ISPS pre-arrival notification. Upon boarding, confirm health status of crew with the Master. During the warning period, all South African citizens are to refrain from consuming food or liquids on board vessels from high risk areas. Gifts of food should be accepted. If a vessel reports infection on-board, Port Health must be informed immediately. The vessel may dock but no persons will be permitted to go on-board until Port Health had boarded and cleared the vessel. If a TNPA pilot is on-board they should report to the TNPA Clinic immediately. All off port limit crew transfers from affected areas to be carefully screened. No crew to be taken off a vessel without obtaining Port Health clearance. Port Health declaration must be completed and is required for all Off Port Limit transfers. Medical evacuations from vessels from affected areas must be screened by Port Health before disembarkation. Captain of the vessel to confirm in writing if any stowaway sweep was completed when departing last port of call. A stowaway search may be requested when alongside. Vessels must use stowaway sweep companies trained by Port Health at the vessel’s cost. Security to inform Port Control of any reported stowaways from vessels calling from affected areas. The vessel may enter the port and the only person permitted to board is the TNPA Pilot. All other persons may board after clearance has been received by Port Health and is alongside. Masters must report stowaways if calling from an affected area. Vessel to remain at anchor until stowaways are examined and cleared by Port Health. Strict gangway watched to be maintained at all times. Separate lists of vessels calling from affected areas are to be maintained for record purposes. Galley waste of vessels from affected areas to be incinerated and not accepted ashore. Additional security to be deployed by agent of vessel for contaminated vessels. No-one must be allowed on-board a contaminated vessel except Port Health. Only after clearance has been received persons will be permitted to board/disembark. All yachts arriving from affected areas must be reported to SAPS and Port Health. The Skipped to be informed to remain isolated on-board until cleared by Port Health. If possible, contaminated vessels should be allocated an isolated berth away from other vessels.

RELATED STORIES : read more about in impact of the infection on an architecture and design perspective. Washington Post and Fortune chief economic correspondent from Asia Clay Chandler writes on Fortune that: “D esign is about more than creating beautiful objects. We’ve embraced the broad notion of design that includes “design thinking,” the use of empathy, brainstorming, prototyping, testing, and other techniques to solve practical problems in areas not traditionally associated with design .” Their contribution can range from rethinking the healthcare system and organise and build cities more efficiently manageable also in terms of hygiene and safety, develop new technologies able to monitor and map realtime data on urban population and even help scientists and public health officials to communicate information about the geography of the disease, how it spreads, and how to stop it through graphic design. Unfortunately, concludes Chandler, design thinking’s methods aren’t widely understood in China. “ Beijing tends to prefer solutions that involve top-down edict and central control rather than “empathy” and “ideation.” The Wuhan outbreak, and China’s struggle to contain it, demonstrates the need for a different approach .” Meanwhile in Wuhan, 1m people thriving metropolis on the Yangtze river where the infection started, 1m people thriving metropolis on the Yangtze river has quarantined the whole city in an effort to contain the outbreak.

Coincidence that less than 3 months later there’s an actual (attempt at) a pandemic?
Then there’s the statement they issue. Now remember boys and girls – this is just a coincidence, right? Statement about nCoV and our pandemic exercise
“In October 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security hosted a pandemic tabletop exercise called Event 201 with partners, the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction. Instead, the exercise served to highlight preparedness and response challenges that would likely arise in a very severe pandemic. We are not now predicting that the nCoV-2019 outbreak will kill 65 million people. Although our tabletop exercise included a mock novel coronavirus, the inputs we used for modeling the potential impact of that fictional virus are not similar to nCoV-2019.”

476,China ‘sacrifices’ Hubei province to save the world from 2019-nCoV,"The number of those who have died from the Wuhan coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV, in China climbed to 361 and cases have been reported in other countries including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and several others.
Musician Zhang Yaru’s grandmother died on Monday after slipping into a coma. She was repeatedly turned away from the hospital.
John Chen, a college graduate, is desperately seeking help for his mom. She has a high fever, but isn’t strong enough to stand in line for hours to be tested for the virus raging through their city.
On the front line, a 30-year-old respiratory doctor has slept only a few hours in two weeks.
Scenes of chaos and despair are emerging daily from China’s Hubei province, the landlocked region of 60 million people where the new coronavirus dubbed 2019-nCoV was first identified in December, and where it has since cut a wide, deadly swathe.
While cases have spread around the globe, the virus’ impact has been most keenly felt in Hubei, which has seen a staggering 97 percent of all deaths from the illness, and 67 percent of all patients.
The toll, which grows larger every day, reflects a local health system overwhelmed by the fast-moving, alien pathogen, making even the most basic care impossible. It’s also an ongoing illustration of the human cost extracted by the world’s largest-known quarantine, with China effectively locking down the region from January 23, 2020, to contain the virus’ spread to the rest of the country, and the world.
But Hubei—known for its car factories and bustling capital Wuhan—is paying the price, with the mortality rate for coronavirus patients there 3.1percent, versus 0.16 percent for the rest of China.
“If the province was not sealed off, some people would have gone all around the country to try to get medical help, and would have turned the whole nation into an epidemic-stricken area,” said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director general of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “The quarantine brought a lot of hardship to Hubei and Wuhan, but it was the right thing to do.”
“It’s like fighting a war—some things are hard, but must be done.”
Wuhan, home to 11 million people, is a “second-tier” Chinese city, meaning it’s relatively developed but still a step below China’s major metropolises of Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. It has well-regarded hospitals, but resources lag behind those of more prominent cities.
In the early days of the virus’ spread, prevarication and delay by local officials also allowed the pathogen to circulate more widely among an unsuspecting public.
While doctors first noticed the virus—thought to have been passed from an animal to humans at a Wuhan food market—in early December, and signs it was being transmitted among people were seen at the beginning of January, authorities still allowed large-scale public events to take place. The scale of the crisis only became fully apparent to the wider public in the days leading up to the start of China’s annual Lunar New Year holiday on January 24, 2020, as cases emerged elsewhere. Caught out
It came “like a sudden downpour that caught Wuhan off guard,” said Zeng Yan, a professor at the school of medicine at Wuhan University of Science and Technology.
The 110 intensive care unit beds in the city designated for virus patients had already been filled many times over when China announced on January 23, 2020, that it would take the unprecedented step of sealing off Wuhan, preventing possible pathogen carriers from traveling out, but also preventing most people from coming in. The quarantine soon widened to encompass nearly the entire province.
In the chaotic, confused days that followed, which coincided with China’s weeklong national holiday, the quarantine restrictions coupled with an already overwhelmed city infrastructure meant that supplies of essential medical equipment including masks, protective suits and high-grade disinfectant were slow to get to Wuhan’s hospitals.
“We were advised to use masks, gloves and protective clothing in a thrifty manner, and avoid drinking water so we would not have to go to the bathroom, which would require a change of protective clothing,” said one frontline doctor working at the Third People’s Hospital of Hubei province, who declined to give her name for fear of reprisal. Supplies stymied
Ding Ze, whose family owns an eyewear company located in another part of China, said that their delivery of medical goggles to Wuhan was delayed by 10 days.
“We sent the supply on January 25 and they arrived at hospitals on February 2,” he said. “All deliveries from outside to the province were slowed by the strict quarantine procedures.”
While China’s government activated eight cargo carriers on February 2, 2020, to ship in 58 tons of supplies to Wuhan, and donations are starting to flow in from all over the world, the shortages in those crucial days—combined with the virus’ rapid spread as the surge in patients saw hospitals turn people away for lack of space—had devastating consequences.
Between January 23 and February 4, 2020, the number of officially recorded deaths from the coronavirus in Hubei grew by over 25 times, to nearly 500. Scores more likely went unrecorded because they weren’t admitted to hospital in time to be diagnosed.
Zhang Yaru’s grandmother was turned away from hospital at the end of January because her symptoms were mild. She slipped into a coma shortly after and died without being diagnosed.
“She didn’t manage to say a word to us before she died, she probably had no idea what happened,” said Zhang, a native of E’Zhou, a smaller city adjacent to Wuhan that’s also being quarantined. “Our family is now driven into a corner, desperate, all my family members are potentially infected and my grandfather is showing the same symptoms.”
While virus cases within Hubei province are still growing by the thousands every day, infections are slowing in the rest of China—an early sign that the aggressive containment may have worked to limit the coronavirus’ spread nationally and globally.
The quarantine was the right thing to do for the good of the wider population, said the doctor at the Third People’s Hospital. “Some may say Hubei was sacrificed, but it did effectively stem the spread to elsewhere.”
The quarantine in Hubei dwarfs previous efforts in other parts of the world. In Liberia in 2014, an impoverished neighborhood of about 70,000 people was shut off during an Ebola outbreak, triggering violent riots. As the lockdown continues with no end in sight, it’s raising ethical and legal questions.
“The lockdown may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus, but you have to ensure there’s enough medical resources to meet the demand for care in those cities,” said Zhang Qianfan, a professor at Peking University Law School. “The lockdown shouldn’t mean the city gets deserted and people are left to survive or die on their own.” Top priority
Reports of potentially preventable deaths in Hubei exacerbated by the quarantine restrictions have been coursing through China, said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at Seton Hall University in New Jersey, and a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Comparing the “draconian measures” in Hubei to the mass surveillance prevalent in China that would seem intolerable to many in the west, he said: “If you ask Chinese people, 8 out of 9 will say they can live with that.”
In the days after the quarantine order, China’s government sent medical assistance into the province, while maintaining restrictions on people leaving.
“I feel like I’m playing a game. It’s like ‘Resident Evil.’ Today and every day I need to do a mission.”
More than 8,000 medical workers from across the country have gone into Hubei, mostly to the 27 hospitals in Wuhan designated for treating coronavirus patients. The rest have fanned out to smaller cities nearby. Two new hospitals, with 2,600 beds in total, were completed in 10 days, built by more than 2,000 migrant workers, while stadiums, offices and hotels are being converted into isolation units.
But hospitals in Hubei are still short of supplies, said a doctor working in the testing department at the Wuhan Tongji hospital. He also declined to give his name on concern he’d face backlash.
“Things are improving, but we are really overloaded and running diagnostic tests 24-7, and still struggle to complete them,” the doctor said on Tuesday. “I think we have not reached the peak of infections yet.” No blame
For those seeking help and medical care in Hubei, resignation has set in—there has been markedly little unrest in the province despite the circumstances. The idea of sacrificing one’s self for a greater, national goal is deeply embedded in Chinese culture, and is invoked by the country’s leaders in times of hardship.
People are queuing for eight hours just to get tested for the coronavirus, said the college graduate, John Chen, who’s 23. His feverish mother is yet to be tested.
“At first I was upset that the hospitals and officials I called for help weren’t willing to do their job, but later I realized that it’s not that they are unwilling to help, but that everywhere is way too short of resources,” he said.
“I don’t blame anyone, because if you grow up in China, you learn that’s how the system works.”",REAL
349,WHO Issues Advice on Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Which Has Killed 17 in China,"As more than 500 people have been infected by a viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (named by WHO as 2019-nCoV), and at least 17 people have died, WHO has issued travel advice and prevention advice for the public. Source: WHO
The good news is that the World Health Organisation (WHO) convened an Emergency Committee which advised that the event does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern… but they did agree on the urgency of the situation, and will reconvene in a few days’ time to reassess the situation. What is Coronavirus 2019-nCoV?
It’s a new virus which comes from the same family as SARS and the common cold, say WHO. Because this is a coronavirus, it usually causes respiratory illness. Where did this Coronavirus begin?
It was first reported in Wuhan City, China, on 31 December 2019, and has since been detected in travellers to other countries, including the USA. WHO is working with the Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus and how to prevent its spread. What are the symptoms of Coronavirus?
Symptoms include fever and occasional difficulty in breathing. Chest radiographs have shown bilateral lung infiltrates. Can Coronavirus be passed on from human to human?
Preliminary investigation suggests that there is no significant human-to-human transmission, and no infections among health care workers have occurred, says WHO.
However transmission potential and modes of transmission remain unclear and more information is required to better understand the mode of transmission and clinical manifestation of this new virus. What is the source of this newly discovered Coronavirus?
The source of this new virus is not yet known, however virologists believe that snakes – the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra – may be the original source of this coronavirus .
For now, the following advice has been issued in relation to the pneumonia outbreak caused by the new coronavirus in China: WHO Advice for the Public
WHO’s standard recommendations for the general public to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses are as follows, which include hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices: Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water; When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands; Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough; If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your health care provider; When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals; The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices. WHO Advice for International Travel and Trade International travellers: practice usual precautions
As transmission potential is still unclear, it would be prudent to reduce the general risk of acute respiratory infections while travelling in or from affected areas (currently Wuhan City) by: avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment; avoiding close contact with live or dead farm or wild animals; travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands).
No restrictions to international traffic have been recommended at this time.

China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said Sunday that “Little is known about the virus that has an incubation period that can range from one to 14 days”.
Minister Ma said “The virus is infectious during the incubation period, and spreads more easily. Infections are expected to continue to rise.”
The health emergency has overwhelmed Wuhan’s hospitals. China has flown in more than half a million medical staff in the areas of prevention, control and treatment operations in the province.
Two new makeshift hospitals are being built in the city and factories are rushing to produce masks and protective clothing.
Ontario has now reported its second case of Wuhan novel coronavirus . In the United States, authorities confirm that a traveler from the Chinese city of Wuhan is the third person to test positive for the virus. The patient is in southern California.
There are 44 reported cases outside of China. Those cases are in Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, Nepal, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, the U.S., and Vietnam.
In Wuhan, the United States, Russia, and France are taking steps to evacuate their diplomatic staff. Canadian Consular Officials Monitoring Situation – Minister
In Canada, François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement:
“The safety and security of Canadians abroad is our top priority. Since January 22, Chinese authorities have restricted non-essential travel to and from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province in China as a result of the spread of coronavirus.
“We understand the concerns of Canadians in the region and those of their families and loved ones. We are in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground.
“Canadian consular officials are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with local authorities and our international partners to gather more information and provide support to the extent possible. Canada does not have a consular presence in Wuhan.
“We continue to advise Canadians to avoid non-essential travel to the province of Hubei, China, including the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang, and Ezhou, due to the heavy travel restrictions that have been imposed. Canadians should check the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice and Advisories for China before traveling.
“Canadians in the region are encouraged to sign up with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service at travel.gc.ca/registration . This will allow them to receive the latest updates from the Government of Canada.
“Canadians in need of emergency consular assistance can contact the Embassy of Canada to China in Beijing at 86 (10) 5139-4000. Canadians can also call Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613 996 8885 or email .” Minister of Health Statement on First Reported Case in Canada
Minister of Health Patty Hajdu issued the following statement:
“The Province of Ontario informed the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) earlier this afternoon that they have a presumptive confirmed travel-related case of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The patient, who recently returned from Wuhan, China, is isolated and under care in hospital. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. This makes it the first case in Canada, pending confirmation of the result by PHAC’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.
The Government of Canada has been working closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, and international partners, since China first reported 2019-nCoV cases to ensure that our country is prepared to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in Canada. Canadian hospitals have strong infection control systems and procedures in place to limit the spread of infection and protect health care workers.
Measures to mitigate the risk of introduction and spread of diseases like the new coronavirus in Canada are in place, including messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver international airports reminding travelers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, and an additional health screening question on electronic kiosks used by international travelers.
While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health care professional if you have traveled to an affected area of China and develop flu-like symptoms. You can find more information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus online at Canada.ca/coronavirus .” ",REAL

AFRICAN countries are stepping up surveillance efforts following the emergence of the first suspected cases of the deadly Novel coronavirus outbreak in the continent this week.
The virus has made global headlines in recent weeks with Africa seemingly exempt but Ivory Coast on Monday became the first country in the continent to test a suspected coronavirus case, when a female student arrived at an airport in the capital Abidjan with suspicious symptoms.
Since then, authorities in Ethiopia have quarantined four students suspected of carrying the virus.
Kenya has also isolated a citizen-who also travelled from China- for having symptoms of the coronavirus.
There has been a noticeable flight of African students based in China returning to the continent as authorities in the Asian nation battle the disease.
Africa is also vulnerable to the spread of the coronavirus owing to the volume of trade and travel between Asia and the continent.
Before the suspected cases in Ethiopia, Ivory Coast and Kenya, the virus that broke out in China had spread to the rest of Asia, Australia, Europe and North America but authorities are leaving nothing to chance.
They are wary of the risk of the current risk of importation of cases of the virus from Wuhan City, the epicentre of the virus that as of the middle of this week left at least 106 people dead.
South Africa has enhanced surveillance of all travelers from Asia, especially China considering most BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) business executives are from China.
The surveillance has been beefed up at the country’s ports of entry, particularly the Oliver Reginald Tambo (O.R.Tambo) and Cape Town International Airports, which are the only gateways with direct flights from Asia.
“South Africans are assured that measures are in place to detect, manage and contain any cases of Novel Coronavirus should it come to our shores,” said Popo Maja, the spokesperson of the national Department of Health.
Port health professionals routinely conduct temperature screening for all international travelers.
While the World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended any restriction of travel or trade, South African authorities have advised travellers to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals.
The majority of the coronavirus cases were linked to a seafood, poultry and live wildlife market in Wuhan City, suggesting that the virus has a possible animal origin.
Travellers have also been advised to practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette in order to reduce the risk of infection with respiratory viruses.
In addition to enhanced surveillance, South Africa has embarked on a campaign to empower public and private health workers on the diagnosis and response to a possible outbreak.
“Provinces have activated outbreak response teams and are on high alert to detect and manage inadvertent cases that may arrive in the country,” said Maja.
In Angola, the government is implementing preventive measures in ports, land borders and overcrowded passenger stops.
The Ministry of Health is leading the exercise that mainly consists of the installation of thermometers in the above mentioned places, mostly the Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport, which is the main international airport of Angola.
“The installation of thermometers at the airport will help promptly identify changes in body temperature and pay special attention to arriving passengers,” Minister of Health, Sílvia Lutucuta, said.
The ministry has established multidisciplinary medical teams at the main airport to carry out necessary controls in all areas of the airport.
On their part, citizens must practise good hygiene such as washing their hands.
Government has encouraged them to pay attention to the virus’ most common symptoms, which include cough, fever and breathing difficulties.
Lutucuta assured that all ministerial departments and the private health sector were working on necessary measures.
Mozambique is also on high alert, government official assured, adding staff at all the country’s health facilities were in readiness.
“We have strengthened the screening services at the points of entry,” said Rosa Marlene Cuco, the National Director of Public Health.
The Ministry of Health, she said, was working with the Foreign Affairs ministry and the National Immigration Service to obtain details of travellers, especially those going to China.
“People travelling overseas should take great care in contact with anyone showing possible symptoms of infection. Any traveller returning from countries at risk of coronavirus must carry out a self-diagnosis before entering Mozambique,” Cuco advised.
A Mozambique student in China is suspected to be carrying the virus and has reportedly been prevented from leaving the Chinese city where he is spending the holidays.
Authorities said this was a precautionary measure.
Tanzania issued a stern statement against members of the public overlooking suspected cases of the virus.
“The ministry warns the public on this,” said the Ministry of Health spokesperson, Gerald Chami.
Minister Ummy Mwalimu’s health ministry stated it would boost airport surveillance for passengers travelling from China and other affected countries.
Tanzania has embarked on an awareness drive among health workers and health workers, with a major focus on entry points.
Quarantine facilities are being considered.
Despite WHO classifying Zambia as a low risk country, the government has boosted surveillance of the killer disease at entry points across the country, mainly airports.
Chilufya, the Minister of Health, confirmed the proceedings.
The use of thermal scanners for temperature monitoring on all arrival passengers is some of the measures.
Chilufya National Public Health Emergency Operations Centre was on high alert.
“The government under is committed to addressing this challenge,” the minister said.
Already, Zambia is at risk of the world’s second worst outbreak of Ebola that has claimed the lives of more than 2 200 people since August 2018 in the northern neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo .
Malawi has also set up screening procedures for people arriving from overseas.
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. They can be spread from human to human.

605,Abidjan handles first suspected case of Corona virus,"The West African Health Organization (WAHO), says the first suspected case of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Africa has been detected in Abidjan, the largest city and chief port of Côte d’Ivoire.
A statement signed by the Director General, West African Health Organization (WAHO) Prof. Stanley Okolo on Monday, noted that the case which was detected at the Abidjan airport recently, has been isolated and undergoing relevant tests to ascertain whether or not infected with the virus.
He advised that even though the World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed the risk assessment of China to be very high and moderate globally, it was very critical for all countries to take collaborative precautionary measures to prevent further spread of the virus.
WAHO has further advised all individuals to frequently wash hands with soap and water, cover their mouths while sneezing or coughing, avoid close contact with any one with fever or cold, avoid raw or undercooked meat or milk and to seek medical care if down with fever, cough or experience difficulty in breathing.
The statement reads in part: “Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
“It is therefore critical that all countries collaborate with each other to take precautionary measures since cases may appear in any country due to international travel. WAHO fully supports WHO’s recommendations to countries regarding active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, and contact tracing to prevent further spread of this outbreak.“
Coordination with ECOWAS Member States WAHO is coordinating with Member States to share real-time information on the outbreak, enhance communication between countries and strengthen countries’ surveillance capacity, including early detection of suspected cases through thermal camera surveillance at international borders.
“One such suspected case arriving Abidjan airport recently was immediately detected and isolated and tests are now being performed to confirm whether this is a case of coronavirus or not. WAHO has also implemented a regional laboratory network for access to rapid biological diagnostic facilities by Member States, and has a standby Regional Rapid Response Team to support countries if required.”
WAHO advised against direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals when visiting markets. At all times, avoid eating raw or undercooked meat. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.

The increase in the number of new infections with the corona virus 2019-nCoV is stabilizing, reports the WHO health organization on Wednesday. However, the WHO emphasizes that this is not yet the end of the outbreak: “This outbreak can still go in any direction.”
China reported the lowest number of new infections in two weeks on Wednesday. In addition, the virus is spreading less aggressively and rapidly outside the province of Hubei, where the virus broke out. According to the WHO, this is because China “doing well” at preventing the further spread.
Of all infections with the virus outside China, 22 percent comes from local transmission. In the rest of the cases, patients have become infected within China.
On Wednesday, the UK Department of Health announced that a ninth infection was detected in the country, but this patient contracted the virus in China.
Meanwhile, more than 40,000 people worldwide have been infected with 2019-nCoV and more than a thousand people have died from the effects of the virus.

Dr. Rolando Enrique Domingo (R), Undersecretary of the Department of Health (DOH)

Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo said that all health workers should wear protective personnel equipment (PPEs) when dealing with patients.
“I strongly advise you to wear protective personnel equipment such as disposable face mask, gown, and gloves when in contact with a patient’s blood, body fluids or secretions, in keeping with the prevailing hospital protocols,” said Domingo.
“I urge you to wash your laundry thoroughly, boost your immunity by taking vitamins, and monitor yourselves for any signs and symptoms. Your health and safety is of paramount concern to the Department,” he added.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III assured that the PPEs will be provided to all health workers.
“That’s one of the first orders of the day when we heightened our infection control, our case management capacities in the hospitals,” he said.
“They are the first ones to be provided with PPEs–that means the googles, headgear, masks, gloves, gowns or aprons, including the shoe guard— they would have to be the first [to have these] because they need to be protected while taking care of those [patients],” he added.
Meanwhile, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) also issued guidelines for private sector workplaces in response to the 2019 nCoV ARD.
The DOLE said that all employers must provide information to their workers about the new virus including how it is being transmitted, disease outcome as well as treatment options for their workers.
They must ensure that their workplaces must be cleaned with disinfectant and that water, soap, and sanitizer must always be available in all their washrooms and toilets.
Employers should avoid or reduce direct exposure of their workers to “animals, environments, and objects which may be possibly carrying the 2019-nCoV [ARD].”
Workers should be reminded to stay healthy and keep their workplaces clean.
The DOLE also advised employers to “monitor the health of workers particularly those with fever and other flu symptoms and those who have traveled to or worked in countries affected with the 2019 nCoV [ARD].
Meanwhile, if a worker is suspected to have been afflicted with the new virus, the employer should provide him or her with a face mask to “prevent risk of spreading the infection.” The worker should immediately be isolated in a separate well-ventilated room.
“Refer the worker to the company healthcare provider or to the nearest local health center or hospital for laboratory confirmation if the history, signs and symptoms are consistent with a suspected case of 2019-nCoV ARD,” the DOLE said.
The employer should report it to the Department of Health and “ensure the implementation of recommendations provided by the DOH on the management and transport of suspected case.”
The DOLE also advised employers to observe “respiratory precautions when taking care of patients with flu or flu-like illness.”",REAL

413,The Corona Virus--1918 All Over Again?,"The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially—in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1600, 3200, 6400, 128000, 256000, 512000, and 1.024 million after only eight doubling times. Biological threats proliferate—until they run out of susceptible victims.
In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in 4 years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and coauthors in their new book Three Seconds until Midnight .
As in1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI), and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.
Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses, and cancelling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.
There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat, in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.",REAL

940,Corona watch on track,"As scientists and researchers across the globe launch a frantic effort to find a vaccine for the novel strain of coronavirus, public health officials here continue their efforts to further strengthen surveillance and the ability to respond quickly with rapid response teams to counter any eventuality.
The fact that no other persons with a travel history to China have tested positive for 2019-nCoV except for the three in Kerala has further added to the belief that strong surveillance would help authorities contain the virus, public health officials maintained.
Fascinating story of surveillance The entire process of surveillance — identifying and reaching out to persons with travel history to China — rolled out by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in association with health officials in different States, resembles a script straight out of Hollywood movies.
With the help of civil aviation officials, the Ministry managed to zero in on the flight that was used by the three persons (from Kerala) who had tested positive for 2019-nCoV to reach India from Wuhan, China.
In that flight, there were 76 other passengers who were from 11 different States seated in close vicinity of the two 2019-nCoV positive passengers. The Ministry, in coordination with health officials in all the States, initiated a massive process of identifying the in-flight contacts, especially those sitting three rows in front and behind the two flyers.
Eventually, all the passengers were identified and those sitting close to the virus-hit were put in strict quarantine in a hospital while the rest are still under observation on a daily basis in a home quarantine setting.
Rapid response teams In case of any contact developing typical disease symptoms, the rapid response teams (RRTs) of the State government are being alerted for deployment at a short notice. Apart from that, just to bolster surveillance, at least 25 isolation beds for 2019-nCoV cases were made available at all the government teaching hospitals in the State.
Committee of doctors The RRT teams in Hyderabad and the districts are being supported by a three-member committee of experts from each government medical colleges. The committee of specialists comprises a community medicine epidemiologist, a physician and a microbiologist to support the activities of RRT for syndromic surveillance, tracing the contacts and specimen testing.
District Collectors The State government has directed the Collectors to implement a slew of measures specifically aimed at containing the virus. A special coronavirus control room in all the districts is being set up that would operate round the clock. Roaster for duty staff at these centres with adequate training to respond and guide callers needs to be ensured.
How does surveillance work? The State integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) teams first alert the district RRT teams with a list of contacts. The names of persons on the list are contacted promptly. If the person does not have any symptoms, they are kept in home isolation and in case there are symptoms, they are taken to the nearest isolation facility for 14 days.
Stock of medical equipment Each teaching hospital in the State has a minimum of 25 beds for quarantine of suspects. In district hospitals, isolation wards, which were already established for H1N1 (swine flu), have been set aside for 2019-nCoV. Hospitals have a stock of at least 25 PPEs (personnel protection equipment) and 100 N95 masks at each teaching hospital and district hospital with isolation wards.

949,From Ebola To Novel Corona Virus: What Are Lessons Learnt? By Mike Adeyemi Lawal,"Incidentally, China is not alone as the spread of the virus continues across over 25 countries, this staggering fact portends a bleak outlook for the global economy, and the sooner this outbreak is brought under control, the better for everyone. by Mike Adeyemi Lawal Feb 07, 2020
When outbreaks occur, there is the possibility of activating a panic mode button in an attempt to immediately halt the spread or prevent further escalation of the situation. The panic response of Nigeria during the 2014 Ebola outbreak has become a success story in outbreak management, in spite of being described as “using a sledgehammer to kill an ant” in terms of resource deployment during the outbreak. Still, the question here is: What has the Ebola outbreak response taught us?
Understanding the situation
It is commendable that World Health Organization has declared the 2019 Novel Corona Virus (nCoV) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); this action has put nCoV on a broader global table for further discussions. A drawback of the 2014 Ebola response was the delay in response to the epidemic which was attributed to both political and technical factors, top among which was the limited understanding of how the disease was spreading in the community, especially among rural dwellers.
The rapid increase of nCoV cases from 282 on 20th January to above 9,000 by the 31st January 2019 makes the spread of nCoV scary. If this situation is not contained early enough, it might lead to a bigger worldwide outbreak at the peak of the epidemic. Also, following the shutdown of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, it was not clear how many infected persons have left the city or those with mild infections not attended to in the limited number of hospitals in Wuhan where most cases were likely to present due to less developed primary health care in China.
Community engagement
Distrust is not uncommon during outbreaks. Outbreaks are always a period of conspiracy theories, wishful narratives and frivolous conclusions. The ugly situations in Liberia and Sierra Leone in the wake of Ebola outbreaks stemmed from family members' attempt to conceal their loved ones who were suspected cases and the subsequent militarization of the response by the Government of Sierra Leone. Were the people callous to allow their loved ones to die? No, but the reality was that they could not figure out what was happening in the no-entry isolation where people went in and came out as corpse. Was that the situation in the treatment isolation? No, but there was an obvious gap in communication between what the health practitioners were doing in the treatment isolation and what the people’s understanding was.
If an outbreak strategy must work, the people should understand the nature of what is affecting them. This includes identifying community power brokers and developing a proper plan for engagement to ensure mutual understanding and collective efforts. It is a fact that the success of outbreak management is how much the smallest unit of the community understands the situation and any gap in communication will be filled by narratives that might jeopardize the outcome of the outbreak.
First things first
The low mortality from nCoV and the doubling time of 7 days give ample opportunity to analyze its genomes and proffer more robust case management that is specific to the virus, including the development of a rapid diagnostic test, effective vaccine and antiviral drugs. However, the fear is putting a lot of efforts on these novel innovations and neglecting the basics in outbreak management for infectious diseases like nCoV, which is - Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC).
Borrowing from my experience in outbreak response, before the development of the Oral cholera vaccines, the success of cholera outbreak response lies mainly on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) strategy and supportive case management with fluid therapy. Until such effective treatment or vaccines are available, the first things first – Infection, Prevention and Control.
Why the world must take nCoV seriously
The death rate from 2019-nCoV is about 2%, and this implies that nCoV is likely to be less virulent compared to Ebola virus, however, selective death among individuals with compromised immunity, young children and older people is a source of concern.
More burden on weak health systems. Despite no confirmed case reported in Africa, it is glaring and predictable that the fragile health systems in most of the countries in the region are inadequate to support a sustained response in case of an outbreak. Furthermore, if the outbreak persists for too long, reactive and disproportionate funding is expected to set in, leading to a reduction in the financing of other global health interventions at national and international levels. This will inadvertently lead to a regression in the achievement made so far in those interventions.
In the press release on the declaration of nCoV as a PHEIC, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of World Health Organization, stated that “The main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in China but what is happening in other countries.” In light of this comes the dimension of a global economic perspective. It is on record that many airlines have suspended their China flight routes, and more countries are putting travel restrictions. The New York Times also reported the slowest pace of the Chinese economy in decades and investors are sceptical on how this will turn out. The Chinese economy plays a crucial role in the global economy being the second largest economy in the world, with about 15.5% of the global economy.
Incidentally, China is not alone as the spread of the virus continues across over 25 countries, this staggering fact portends a bleak outlook for the global economy, and the sooner this outbreak is brought under control, the better for everyone.

820,China: Statement on the second meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV),"The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV in the People’s Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thursday, 30 January 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee’s role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate.
Proceedings of the meeting
The Director-General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin.
Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat.
A representative of the department of Compliance, Risk management, and Ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities.
Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting.
The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters.
Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken. There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital.
The WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries. There are now 82 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China. One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths.
At its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but the Committee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion.
This second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases.
Conclusions and advice
The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government authorities, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools.
The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support. The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world.
The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners.
The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns, cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month, and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China.
The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early, isolate and treat cases, trace contacts, and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection. The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations.
The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China, its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak, with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success. In line with the need for global solidarity, the committee felt that a global coordinated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that.
Advice to WHO
The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China, including national experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak, the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to-human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak. This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures.
The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source, to rule out ongoing hidden transmission.
The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring.
The Committee would welcome strong leadership to engage in the discussion about proportionality in control measures, particularly with regard to potentially damaging travel and trade restrictions.
WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally.
WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions.
Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed.
WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus.
WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005).
The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC, accepted the Committee’s advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR (2005).
To the People’s Republic of China
Continue to:
Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment.
Enhance rational public health measures for containment of the current outbreak.
Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce.
Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China.
Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it.
Share full data on all human cases.
Strengthen the efforts to identify a zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for ongoing circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available.
Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic.
To all countries
It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019-nCoV infection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website .
Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR (2005).
Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi-sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease, as well as advancing research.
The Committee acknowledged that, in general, evidence has shown that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies may be ineffective and may divert resources from other interventions. Further, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative effects on the economies of countries affected by the emergencies.
However, in certain specific circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with limited response capacities and capabilities, or where there is high intensity of transmission among vulnerable populations.
In such situations, countries should perform risk and cost-benefit analyses before implementing such restrictions to assess whether the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks. Countries must inform WHO about any travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR.
The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation.
To the global community
As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment.
Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics.
Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures. WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received.
The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General.
The Director-General thanked the Committee for its work.

233,DOH Confirms Third Case of 2019-nCoV in the Philippines,"The Department of Health has confirmed the third case of the 2019 novel coronavirus in the Philippines. The patient is a 60-year old woman who traveled from Wuhan, China, which is currently on lockdown, to Hong Kong, to Cebu, and then to Bohol where she went into a hospital for a checkup for her fever.
She reportedly arrived in the country on January 20 and was admitted in a Bohol hospital on January 22. She was officially diagnosed with 2019-nCoV a few days later, although this case was only revealed by the DOH today.
Samples of the patient taken on January 23 were tested positive for 2019-nCoV, but sampels taken on January 24 tested negative, implying that the patient built a natural immunity to the virus.
The patient has since been discharged, returning to China on January 31.
